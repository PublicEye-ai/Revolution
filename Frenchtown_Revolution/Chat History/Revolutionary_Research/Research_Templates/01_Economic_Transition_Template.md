# ðŸ’° Research Template: Economic Transition Management

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Question
How do societies successfully transition between economic systems without collapse, and how can AI assist in preventing historical failures like the assignat crisis?

## ðŸ“Š Phase 1: Historical Analysis

### Case Study Collection
- [ ] French Revolution assignat crisis (1789-1796)
- [ ] American currency transition (1776-1790s)
- [ ] English Commonwealth economic policies (1649-1660)
- [ ] Meiji Restoration economic transformation (1868-1912)
- [ ] Post-Soviet transitions (1989-present)

### For Each Case, Document:

#### 1. Initial Economic Conditions
- Debt levels (% of GDP, total amounts)
- Currency status (stability, trust, convertibility)
- Trade relationships (partners, volumes, dependencies)
- Wealth distribution (Gini coefficient, class structure)

#### 2. Transition Mechanisms
- Currency changes (old â†’ new systems)
- Property redistribution (methods, scale, speed)
- Debt handling (repudiation, restructuring, assumption)
- New financial institutions (central banks, regulations)

#### 3. Success/Failure Factors
- What worked? (specific policies and why)
- What failed? (mistakes and their causes)
- Turning points (critical decisions/events)
- Could AI have helped? (information gaps, prediction needs)
