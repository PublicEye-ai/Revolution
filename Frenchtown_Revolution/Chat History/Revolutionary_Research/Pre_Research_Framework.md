# üìã Pre-Research Framework: Preparing for Deep Investigation

## üéØ Overview

This framework ensures each research topic is approached systematically, with clear objectives and methods defined before diving into sources.

## üîç Universal Pre-Research Checklist

### Before Starting Any Topic:

1. **Define Success Criteria**
   - What specific questions must be answered?
   - What would a successful research outcome look like?
   - How will findings be applied practically?

2. **Identify Knowledge Gaps**
   - What do I already know?
   - What assumptions need challenging?
   - Where might my biases lie?

3. **Resource Assessment**
   - What sources are available?
   - What expertise is needed?
   - Time allocation for research

4. **Output Planning**
   - What format will findings take?
   - Who is the audience?
   - How will it integrate with other research?

## üìä Phase 1: Foundation Pre-Research

### Economic Transition Management

#### Pre-Research Setup:
- **Core Question**: How do you change economic systems without destroying livelihoods?
- **Success Metrics**: Find 3+ successful transitions, identify common patterns
- **Time Allocation**: 40 hours initial research

#### Background Knowledge Required:
- Basic economic theory (inflation, currency, markets)
- Historical context of target transitions
- Modern parallels (cryptocurrency, digital currencies)

#### Key Hypotheses to Test:
1. Speed of transition correlates with instability
2. Parallel systems work better than replacement
3. Trust matters more than technical design

#### Research Boundaries:
- Focus on currency/monetary transitions
- Include both state and market perspectives
- Examine 5-year windows around transitions

### Information Systems Pre-Research

#### Pre-Research Setup:
- **Core Question**: How much information does good governance require?
- **Success Metrics**: Define optimal information flows, identify surveillance risks
- **Time Allocation**: 35 hours initial research
#### Background Knowledge Required:
- Information theory basics
- Surveillance state examples
- Democratic feedback mechanisms

#### Key Hypotheses to Test:
1. More information doesn't equal better decisions
2. Transparency and efficiency often conflict
3. Aggregation methods matter more than data volume

#### Research Boundaries:
- Distinguish governance data from surveillance
- Focus on decision-making, not control
- Include citizen feedback mechanisms

### Building Legitimate Authority Pre-Research

#### Pre-Research Setup:
- **Core Question**: How do new systems gain genuine acceptance?
- **Success Metrics**: Identify legitimacy transfer mechanisms, timeline requirements
- **Time Allocation**: 30 hours initial research

#### Background Knowledge Required:
- Political legitimacy theory
- Symbolic power concepts
- Social contract philosophy

#### Key Hypotheses to Test:
1. Legitimacy requires both force and consent
2. Symbolic acts matter as much as material benefits
3. AI systems face unique legitimacy challenges

#### Research Boundaries:
- Focus on first 5 years of new regimes
- Include both democratic and authoritarian examples
- Examine role of external recognition

## üéØ Pre-Research Deliverables

### Before Beginning Deep Research, Produce:

1. **Research Proposal** (1-2 pages)
   - Clear problem statement
   - Methodology overview
   - Expected outcomes
   - Timeline and milestones

2. **Source Map** (Visual diagram)
   - Primary source locations
   - Secondary source categories
   - Modern parallels
   - Expert contacts

3. **Hypothesis Framework** (1 page)
   - Core assumptions to test
   - Expected findings
   - Potential surprises
   - Bias acknowledgment

4. **Integration Plan** (1 page)
   - How this connects to other topics
   - Dependencies and prerequisites
   - Contribution to overall project

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pre-Research Pitfalls

### Avoid These Mistakes:

1. **Too Broad Focus**
   - Trying to solve everything at once
   - Not defining specific questions
   - Lacking clear boundaries

2. **Confirmation Bias**
   - Only looking for supporting evidence
   - Ignoring contrary examples
   - Predetermined conclusions

3. **Source Limitations**
   - Over-relying on secondary sources
   - Language barriers ignored
   - Access issues not anticipated

4. **Integration Failures**
   - Researching in isolation
   - Not connecting to other topics
   - Missing practical applications

## üîÑ Pre-Research Review Questions

### Before Starting, Ask:

1. Is my research question specific and answerable?
2. Do I have access to necessary sources?
3. Have I allocated sufficient time?
4. Will the findings be practically applicable?
5. How will this advance the overall project?
6. What biases might affect my research?
7. Who can provide expert guidance?
8. What would make this research fail?

## üìö Next Steps

Once pre-research is complete:
1. Begin with [[Primary_Sources_Framework]]
2. Apply [[Deep_Research_Topics]] methodology
3. Use [[Post_Research_Framework]] for synthesis
4. Create deliverables per [[Research_Progression]]

Remember: Good preparation prevents poor performance. Time spent in pre-research saves multiples in execution.
