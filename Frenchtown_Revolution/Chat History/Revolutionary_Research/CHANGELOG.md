### Core Thesis Developed
"Successful transformation requires not just destroying old systems but carefully building new ones. AI can help reduce human corruption, but only if implemented with historical wisdom about power, legitimacy, and human nature."

---

## Phase 0 - Project Inception

### Origin
- Started from conversation about collapse and rebuilding
- Identified gap in revolutionary success planning
- Recognized AI as both opportunity and threat
- Committed to learning from history

2. Design systems that avoid historical mistakes
3. Integrate AI thoughtfully
4. Create practical implementation guides
5. Maintain human agency and dignity

---

## Major Design Decisions Throughout

### Content Structure
- **Phase-based not time-based**: Allows natural progression
- **Practical over theoretical**: Every document must be actionable
- **Historical grounding**: All recommendations based on evidence
- **AI as tool**: Technology serves human goals
- **Comprehensive scope**: Address all aspects of governance

### Quality Standards
- **Depth over breadth**: Better to cover less thoroughly
- **Examples required**: Abstract principles must have concrete illustrations
- **Warnings prominent**: Historical failures highlighted
- **Implementation focused**: Theory must lead to practice
- **Human-centered**: People's needs drive all decisions

### Technical Choices
- **Markdown format**: Universal accessibility
- **Emoji navigation**: Visual scanning aids
- **Cross-references**: Integrated knowledge web
- **Modular structure**: Use what you need
- **Version control ready**: Built for collaboration
