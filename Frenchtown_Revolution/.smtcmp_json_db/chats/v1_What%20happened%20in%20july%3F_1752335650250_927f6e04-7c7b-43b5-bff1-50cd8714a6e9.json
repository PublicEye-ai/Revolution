      "content": "# July Events of the French Revolution\n\nSeveral key events of the French Revolution occurred in July, most notably:\n\n## Storming of the Bastille - July 14, 1789\n\nThe most famous July event was the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789. Think of the Bastille as a giant stone castle in Paris that symbolized royal power. The people of Paris attacked it, not just to free prisoners (there were only seven inside), but as a powerful statement against King Louis XVI's authority. \n\nThis event is so important that July 14 is now France's national holiday (Bastille Day).\n\n## Other Notable July Events\n\n- **July 1789**: Formation of the National Guard led by Lafayette\n- **July 12, 1790**: Civil Constitution of the Clergy was passed\n- **July 17, 1791**: The \"Champ de Mars Massacre\" when National Guard fired on protestors\n- **July 27, 1794**: The Thermidorian Reaction ended Robespierre's Reign of Terror\n\nWould you like more details about any of these specific events?",

This was like firing the one government official people trusted during an economic crisis.\n\n- **July 12, 1789**: News of Necker's dismissal reached Paris, causing immediate public outrage. A journalist named Camille Desmoulins gave a passionate speech at the Palais-Royal, calling citizens to arms. Crowds gathered, wearing green ribbons (Necker's color) as a symbol of protest. \n\n- **July 12, 1789**: The angry crowds clashed with the Royal-German regiment at the Tuileries Gardens. This was one of the first violent confrontations of the Revolution.\n\nThese events directly set the stage for the Storming of the Bastille two days later on July 14.",
