### üéØ Why This Matters to You

- Pick ONE pilot from [[Pilot_Program_Designs]]
- Suggested: Budget Transparency AI
- Budget needed: ~$300,000
- Timeline: 12 months to results

#### 2. Build Coalition (Month 2)
- **Tech Partner**: Local university or civic tech group
- **Citizen Advisory**: 7-9 diverse community members
