# Citizen Advocate Quick Start Guide

## Your Voice in AI-Powered Government

### üéØ Why This Matters to You

Your government is adopting AI. This could mean faster services and less corruption‚Äîor it could mean less privacy and human judgment. Your involvement determines which future we get.

**Your Power**: Citizens who engage early shape how AI serves the community.
