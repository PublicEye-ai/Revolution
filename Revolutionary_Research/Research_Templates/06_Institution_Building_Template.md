# üè¢ Research Template: Institution Building

## üéØ Research Question
How do revolutionary governments build lasting institutions that preserve knowledge and function across political transitions, and how can AI create institutional memory without institutional capture?

## üìä Phase 1: Historical Analysis

### Case Study Collection
- [ ] French Revolution institution creation (1789-1799)
- [ ] American federal departments (1789-1800)
- [ ] Meiji bureaucracy building (1868-1890)
- [ ] Post-colonial institutions (various)
- [ ] EU institution development (1957-present)
- [ ] Post-Soviet transitions (1991-present)

### For Each Case, Document:

#### 1. Institution Creation
- Founding purpose and mission
- Initial structure and staffing
- Resource allocation
- Authority definition

#### 2. Knowledge Systems
- Record keeping methods
- Training programs
- Succession planning
- Institutional memory

#### 3. Resilience Factors
- Survived regime changes?
- Adapted to new needs?
- Maintained competence?
- Avoided capture?
