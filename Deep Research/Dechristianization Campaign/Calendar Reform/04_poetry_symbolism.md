## Introduction: Remaking Time, Remaking Man

  

The French Republican Calendar, implemented by the National Convention in October 1793, represents the Revolution's most audacious and comprehensive attempt at social and cultural engineering.1 Far more than a mere timekeeping device, it was a sophisticated instrument of political communication, ideological mobilization, and social control, designed to erase the temporal and symbolic framework of the

Ancien Régime and forge a new Republican citizen in the crucible of "Reason" and "Nature." The calendar's ambition was nothing less than to "substitut[e] for visions of ignorance the realities of reason, and for the sacred... the truth of nature" 3 and to "create a new collective memory for the nascent French Republic".4

The calendar was the product of two distinct but complementary revolutionary impulses: the scientific rationalism of mathematicians like Charles-Gilbert Romme and the poetic, propagandistic vision of the playwright Philippe-François-Nazaire Fabre d'Églantine.2 Their collaboration, which also involved figures like the painter Jacques-Louis David and the mathematician Gaspard Monge, created a system that was simultaneously a feat of decimal logic and what one scholar has termed a "calendar-narration".5 This narrative was intended to reshape the French imagination, reorienting it away from the Church and the monarchy and towards the soil, the seasons, and the productive labor of the nation.5

This report analyzes the calendar's journey from its intellectual conception in Enlightenment philosophy to its practical failure in the face of popular resistance and political pragmatism. It argues that the calendar's ultimate demise reveals the profound limits of imposing a top-down, abstract ideology onto the deeply ingrained rhythms of culture, work, and faith. The calendar's story is the story of the Revolution itself: a utopian ambition for total regeneration colliding with the resilient complexities of human society. Its goal was to "make time express the intentions of history" 4, a project of stunning scope that, while ultimately unsuccessful, left an indelible mark on the language and memory of the revolutionary era.

  

## Part I: The Genesis of a New Epoch

  

The creation of the Republican Calendar was not a spontaneous act of radicalism but the culmination of intellectual and political currents that had been building for decades. It was born from the Enlightenment's demand for rationality, fueled by the Revolution's violent campaign of de-Christianization, and conceived as an essential tool for creating a new type of citizen, loyal only to the Republic and its principles.

  

### Chapter 1: The Enlightenment Mandate: Rationalism, Nature, and the Rejection of the Past

  

The intellectual foundation of the Republican Calendar lies in the Enlightenment's profound faith in reason and its critique of inherited traditions. Revolutionaries and the thinkers who inspired them viewed the Gregorian calendar as a prime example of an irrational system, a "joyeux fatras" (joyful jumble) of pagan deities (January for Janus, March for Mars), Roman emperors (July for Julius Caesar, August for Augustus), and illogical numbering (September, the "seventh" month, being the ninth).2 The reform was thus driven by a desire to create a more scientific and rational system, one that would be in harmony with nature and logic.1

This impulse connected the calendar directly to the other great rationalizing project of the era: the metric system. Both were attempts to sweep away the arbitrary and inconsistent measures of the Ancien Régime and replace them with universal systems based on natural constants and decimal logic.7 The calendar's division of the day into ten hours, the hour into 100 decimal minutes, and the minute into 100 decimal seconds was the temporal equivalent of the meter and the gram—an effort to apply a single, coherent mathematical principle to the measurement of all things.11 The calendar's creation was thus more than a political whim; it was the logical endpoint of a philosophical project that believed human society could, and should, be re-engineered according to scientific principles. The revolutionaries saw the Gregorian calendar as a flawed and inefficient system inherited from an age of superstition, and as enlightened modernizers, they were determined to correct it.

The idea of a secularized calendar did not emerge from a vacuum. As early as 1788, the prominent anti-clerical writer Pierre-Sylvain Maréchal had published his Almanach des Honnêtes Gens (Almanac of Honest People). This work proposed a calendar that replaced saints' days with the names of noteworthy secular figures—assigning December 25th to both Jesus and Isaac Newton—and renamed the months with simple numerical designations like "Princeps" (First) for March.1 Maréchal's almanac demonstrated that the intellectual groundwork for such a reform predated the Republic itself, establishing a precedent for a calendar based not on divine revelation but on human reason and achievement.

  

### Chapter 2: De-Christianization and the War on Symbols

  

While rooted in Enlightenment rationalism, the calendar was forged in the fire of the Revolution's aggressive de-Christianization campaign. It was a primary weapon in a cultural war intended to "remove all royalist and Christian elements" from the daily life of the French citizen.7 Fabre d'Églantine, in his report to the Convention, condemned the old calendar as a tool used by the Church to keep people in a state of "superstition contaminated with bigotry, deceit and falseness," a "catalogue of lies" that had to be eradicated.14 The goal of the revolutionary government between 1793 and 1794 was not merely to reform the Church but, for many, to terminate religious practice altogether.16

The calendar's attack on religion was systematic and total. The most significant structural change was the abolition of the seven-day week and its replacement with the ten-day décade.17 This was a direct assault on the cornerstone of Christian timekeeping: Sunday (

dimanche, the Lord's Day), which was eliminated as the day of rest and worship.19 This structural change was accompanied by a complete symbolic replacement. Every one of the 365 days of the year was stripped of its associated saint and given a new secular name drawn from the natural world.1 This act of symbolic conquest was not merely secularizing but actively and aggressively anti-clerical. It aimed to desacralize the old world and re-sacralize the new one around the values of labor, nature, and agricultural production.

This symbolic warfare was part of a much broader, often violent, campaign. Across France, revolutionary authorities suppressed the Church, nationalized its property, exiled some 30,000 priests, and executed hundreds more.19 The Law of Suspects (September 17, 1793) was used to actively pursue the destruction of all "external signs of worship," including crosses and bells, and to establish new secular cults like the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme Being.16 The calendar was the daily, inescapable instrument of this new order. The thoroughness of the replacement is key; not a single day was left untouched, mirroring the totality of the wider campaign. The choice of humble, earthy names—including

Fumier (Manure) for the 8th of Nivôse—can be interpreted as a deliberate profanity, a grounding in the material world designed to mock and supplant the spiritual world of the saints.15 Every time a citizen dated a letter, read an almanac, or planned their work, they were forced to participate in the rejection of the Church and the affirmation of the Republic's new materialist faith.

  

### Chapter 3: Forging the Republican Citizen

  

Beyond its rationalist and anti-clerical aims, the calendar was fundamentally a constructive project: an attempt to forge a new Republican citizen with a new collective memory.4 The Revolution had struggled with its own timeline. Various dates—the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789 ("Year I of Liberty"), the Fête de la Fédération on July 14, 1790, and the overthrow of the monarchy on August 10, 1792 ("Year I of Equality")—competed as the true "beginning" of the new era.12 This "coexistence of multiple time lines" created a narrative confusion that undermined the Republic's legitimacy.21

The Convention resolved this crisis by retroactively designating September 22, 1792—the day the Republic was formally proclaimed—as the start of Year I.1 The choice of this date was a masterstroke of symbolic communication. It was not only a politically significant anniversary but also the day of the autumnal equinox, the moment when, as Romme proudly declared to the Convention, the "equality of day and night was marked in the heavens".2 By anchoring their political creation in an astronomical event, the revolutionaries elevated the Republic from a mere historical contingency to a cosmic inevitability, sanctioned by Nature itself. This act of myth-making was a sophisticated piece of propaganda aimed at writing a definitive, unchallengeable origin story for the Republic, erasing the messy and contested history that had preceded it.

The calendar was therefore conceived as a "Republican Institution" and a powerful educational tool.2 Fabre d'Églantine's explicit goal was to "consecrate through the calendar the agricultural system and lead the nation back to it" and to "strike the imagination with names and to instruct through nature".5 In his report, he argued that humans conceive of the world through images, and thus the new calendar must be filled with images that would easily penetrate the public's mind and memory.22 This "calendar-narration" 5 was a communication strategy directed as much at unifying the revolutionaries around a single narrative as it was at instructing the general populace. It was designed to stop the arguments about when the "new world" began by providing a definitive, seemingly objective answer, thereby creating a shared experience of time, which is the "sine qua non of collective life".4

  

## Part II: The Architecture of a Republican Year

  

The design of the Republican Calendar, largely credited to the poetic sensibilities of Fabre d'Églantine, is a remarkable monument to the revolutionary ambition to create a system that was at once rational, natural, memorable, and deeply symbolic. Its structure was a complete narrative, guiding the citizen through a year defined not by saints and kings, but by the rhythms of the earth and the virtues of the Republic.

  

### Chapter 4: The Poetics of the Seasons: A Lyrical Analysis of the Month Names

  

The task of naming the months fell to Fabre d'Églantine, a figure known for his talents as a poet, actor, and politician.14 Rejecting the historical-commemorative approach initially favored by Romme, which would have named months after revolutionary events like "Bastille," Fabre turned instead to nature.12 His approach was explicitly poetic, aiming to create neologisms that would be evocative and easily memorized. As he explained in his report, his core principle was to "give to each month of the year a characteristic name" that would allow one to "feel the kind of season in which it is found".5

To achieve this, he devised an ingenious system of "sonority," grouping the months into four seasonal triads, each unified by a common rhyming suffix.6 This structure served as a brilliant mnemonic device, particularly for a society with varying levels of literacy. It transformed the calendar from a written document into an oral and acoustic system. The seasonal "sonority" (

sonorité) allowed the new temporal order to be learned, recited, and memorized through sound, embedding it more deeply in the popular consciousness than a purely visual system could have.6 In an age before mass media, where oral transmission was key, making the seasons rhyme created a system that was catchy and easy to teach. A child could learn the rhythm of the year, a powerful tool for displacing the old, familiar names.

The names themselves were skillfully crafted from French, Latin, and Greek roots, chosen to describe the prevailing weather and agricultural activities of the Paris basin.12 This Paris-centric view would later become a point of contention, but the poetic effect was undeniable. The controversy over the name for the month of heat—initially proposed by Fabre as the Latin-derived

Fervidor ("burning hot") but ultimately changed to the Greek-derived Thermidor ("summer heat"), allegedly at the insistence of Romme—reveals the creative tensions within the committee but also the careful consideration given to each name's etymological and phonetic properties.15

The complete poetic system is laid out in the table below.

Table 1: The Republican Months: Etymology, Symbolism, and Poetic Structure

### Chapter 5: The Rural Almanac: Systematizing the Days of the Year

  

Fabre d'Églantine's systematic vision extended to every day of the year. He replaced the Catholic calendar of saints with a new secular almanac based on what he called "the objects that make up the true riches of the nation, worthy objects not from a cult, but from agriculture".15 This was not a random collection of rustic terms but a meticulously organized "calendar-narration" designed to function as a year-long lesson on the French agricultural economy.5 It was a secular liturgy of labor that replaced a history of sacred martyrdom with a celebration of material productivity.

The system was built on a clear hierarchy. Each of the three décades in a month followed a precise pattern, transforming the calendar into a didactic tool that instructed citizens on the cycles of production, the tools of their trade, and the natural wealth of the nation.

- Days ending in 5 (Quintidi): These days were named for a common domestic animal. Fabre insisted on a "precise relationship between the date of this inscription and the real utility of the inscribed animal" at that time of year.5
    
- Days ending in 0 (Décadi): These days, the official day of rest, were named for an agricultural tool. The tool chosen was one "the farmer uses at the precise time where it is placed" in the calendar.5
    
- All Other Days: The remaining 24 days of each month were named for plants, flowers, fruits, trees, or roots appropriate to the season.11
    

This obsessive desire to create a totalizing, rational worldview is evident in the details. The Pressoir (Wine-Press) appears on 20 Vendémiaire, and the Tonneau (Barrel) on 30 Vendémiaire, perfectly aligned with the month of the grape harvest.15 The

Faux (Scythe) appears on 10 Prairial, the month of meadows.15 The one exception to the botanical theme was the winter month of

Nivôse. Here, with little growing, the days were named for minerals and substances found beneath the earth—Tourbe (Peat), Houille (Coal), Argile (Clay), Fer (Iron)—shifting the focus to the nation's geological wealth when its agricultural wealth lay dormant.15 A citizen living through the year was not just marking time but was being educated, day by day, on the material foundations of the Republic.

Table 2: The Agrarian Almanac: The Naming System of the Republican Days

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Jour de la Décade|Name Type|Example (from Vendémiaire, Month of Vintage)|
|Primidi, Duodi, Tridi, Quartidi|Plant / Fruit / Root|Raisin (Grape), Safran (Saffron), Châtaigne (Chestnut), Colchique (Crocus)|
|Quintidi|Animal|Cheval (Horse)|
|Sextidi, Septidi, Octidi, Nonidi|Plant / Fruit / Root|Balsamine (Impatiens), Carotte (Carrot), Amaranthe (Amaranth), Panais (Parsnip)|
|Décadi|Agricultural Tool|Cuve (Vat)|

  

### Chapter 6: The Sans-culottides: The Codification of Civic Virtue

  

To account for the 365 days of the solar year, five "complementary days" (jours complémentaires) were added after the final month of Fructidor. In a populist gesture, these days were collectively named the Sans-culottides, in honor of the revolutionary working class.12 These days functioned as the moral and philosophical climax of the Republican year. While the twelve months celebrated the material body of the nation—its agriculture and labor—these five days celebrated its soul: the abstract Enlightenment ideals that gave it life.

Each day was a national festival dedicated to a core republican virtue.6 They were a direct and explicit replacement for the great narrative festivals of the Christian calendar (Christmas, Easter, Pentecost), substituting the story of salvation with a catechism of civic virtue.

Table 3: The Sans-culottides: The Republican Feasts of Virtue

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Complementary Day|Name of Feast|Celebrated Virtue/Concept|Gregorian Date (approx.)|
|1st|La Fête de la Vertu|Feast of Virtue|September 17|
|2nd|La Fête du Génie|Feast of Genius|September 18|
|3rd|La Fête du Travail|Feast of Labor|September 19|
|4th|La Fête de l'Opinion|Feast of Opinion|September 20|
|5th|La Fête des Récompenses|Feast of Rewards|September 21|
|6th (Leap Year)|Le Jour de la Révolution|The Day of the Revolution|September 22|

This structure reveals the intellectual, top-down character of the revolutionary project. The highest form of celebration is the celebration of pure concepts. The Fête de l'Opinion, in particular, is a radical Enlightenment idea. Fabre d'Églantine defined it as a festival "more feared by the people's elected officials than the laws themselves," a day dedicated to the sacred right of free expression and political satire.8 In establishing these feasts, the Republic was consecrating its own philosophical foundations as the new national religion.

  

## Part III: The Calendar in Practice: Mobilization, Communication, and Resistance

  

The creation of the Republican Calendar was one thing; its implementation was another entirely. The revolutionary state deployed a sophisticated campaign of enforcement and propaganda to embed the new system in the daily lives of its citizens. However, this top-down effort collided with the powerful inertia of tradition, the physical demands of labor, and the cultural diversity of the nation, sparking both overt and passive resistance that ultimately doomed the project.

  

### Chapter 7: Disseminating the New Time: Propaganda and Enforcement

  

The calendar was established by a decree of the National Convention on October 5, 1793, and its use was mandated for all public acts.1 The Committee of Public Instruction was charged with printing and distributing the new calendar, along with instructional materials, to all levels of government, municipalities, tribunals, schools, and the army.13 This bureaucratic rollout was remarkably swift in some regions, demonstrating the growing effectiveness of the revolutionary state apparatus.2

This legal mandate was supported by one of the first modern, state-led mass communication campaigns. The revolutionary government employed a multi-platform strategy that combined legal enforcement with cultural persuasion, using both text and image to drive adoption.

- Printed Materials: A flood of printed matter was produced. Pocket-sized almanacs and concordances, which provided conversion tables to the old "vulgar era," became essential tools for navigating the new system.26 These almanacs were a significant genre of popular literature, and their widespread circulation was crucial for dissemination.27
    
- Visual Propaganda: The state understood that logic alone was not enough; the new system had to be made aesthetically and emotionally appealing. A series of striking allegorical prints by artists Louis Lafitte and Salvatore Tresca personified the new months as beautiful neoclassical women engaged in seasonal activities, making the abstract names tangible and attractive.5 The calendar was also depicted on everyday items like clocks, watches, and even playing cards, integrating it into the visual fabric of daily life.28
    
- Public Spectacle: The new temporal order was celebrated in public performances. In Paris, plays like L'Heureuse Décade celebrated the décadi as a day of republican rest, while in Bordeaux, a grand ballet titled Le Calendrier Républicain used dancers to represent the new months and their associated agricultural activities.2
    

The revolutionaries were pioneers of modern propaganda. They recognized that to change a fundamental aspect of life like time, one had to saturate the public sphere with new symbols, new images, and new stories. The calendar's dissemination strategy is a powerful example of the state attempting to actively shape public consciousness and create a new, shared culture.

  

### Chapter 8: Popular Reception and Resistance

  

Despite the state's comprehensive efforts, the calendar was never truly popular and faced widespread resistance, both passive and active.11 The reasons for this opposition were varied, stemming from practical grievances, cultural alienation, and the deep resilience of religious tradition.

The single most significant source of popular opposition was the ten-day week. The décade extended the work period from six days to nine between days of rest. This change was deeply resented by laborers and farmers, who found the new rhythm physically exhausting for both "men and animals".2 This practical, material grievance likely outweighed any abstract ideological objections for a majority of the population and "drew the ire of the country's laborers".3

Furthermore, the calendar failed to account for the lived reality of the French people. The persistence of Sunday observance became a widespread form of passive resistance. Across the country, people continued to treat the ci-devant dimanche as the day of rest, wearing their best clothes, ceasing work, and promenading in public.2 This simple act of resting on the "wrong" day became a potent, if quiet, political statement.

The calendar's cultural and geographical bias also fueled opposition. Its nomenclature was based entirely on the climate and agriculture of the Paris region, rendering it nonsensical in other parts of the nation and its overseas colonies.8 The month of

Nivôse (Snowy) was absurd in the sunny south of France and "downright chauvinistic" in tropical territories like Haiti.3 This "nombrilisme français" (French navel-gazing) exposed the false universalism of the project and undermined its claims to be based on "Nature" and "Reason".8 This disconnect led to mockery abroad, most famously in rival Britain, where a wit published a derisive translation of the month names: "Wheezy, Sneezy, and Freezy; Slippy, Drippy, and Nippy; Showery, Flowery, and Bowery; and Hoppy, Croppy, and Poppy".3 The calendar ultimately failed because it was designed for an abstract "Republican Citizen" who did not exist. The real French citizen was a laborer who grew tired, a Catholic who valued Sunday, and a provincial who knew that the rhythms of their own region did not match those of Paris.

  

### Chapter 9: A Tool of Division

  

Intended to create a unified national identity, the calendar in practice often became a source of local division, surveillance, and social control. It quickly evolved into a litmus test for political loyalty. Adherence was seen as a sign of patriotism, while opposition or non-compliance was treated as suspect and potentially counter-revolutionary.2

During the Terror, local Jacobin clubs and surveillance committees took it upon themselves to enforce the new calendar. They monitored who worked on the décadi and who rested on Sunday, leading to denunciations and open conflict.2 The calendar became a pretext for justifying the ongoing de-Christianization campaign, with priests who encouraged Sunday observance being attacked for hindering its establishment.2 By inserting a new set of rules into the fabric of daily life, the calendar created countless new opportunities for friction. It pitted neighbor against neighbor and the state against the individual over seemingly mundane issues like when to work, when to rest, and when to hold a market.

The reception in the provinces, however, was not uniformly hostile. A detailed study of the district of Pontarlier in the Doubs region—a remote and devoutly Catholic area—reveals a more complex picture.33 While local administrators did adopt the new dating system in official acts (albeit with some delay), the general population overwhelmingly resisted the

décadi and almost never used the new agrarian names for their children. Crucially, this resistance was selective. It was not necessarily perceived by the authorities or the people themselves as a wholesale rejection of the Revolution. This suggests that communities could distinguish between the different elements of the revolutionary project, accepting some while rejecting others. The calendar failed as a tool of unity because it became a tool of coercion and a marker of the very divisions it was meant to overcome.

  

## Part IV: The Unwinding of Republican Time

  

The Republican Calendar was a creature of the Revolution's most radical phase. As the political tides turned and the utopian fervor cooled, its ideological purity became a practical and political liability. Its decline and eventual abolition were directly tied to the fall of the Jacobins and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, who prioritized pragmatism and social order over revolutionary symbolism.

  

### Chapter 10: The Thermidorian Reaction and Napoleonic Pragmatism

  

The fall of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor, Year II—a date ironically immortalized by the very calendar he championed—marked a decisive turning point.1 In the subsequent Thermidorian Reaction, the "extremes of the Jacobin regime" came under attack, and open criticism of the calendar became possible.2 While it remained the official dating system, the state's will to enforce it declined significantly.2

The final blow came with Napoleon Bonaparte. His coup of 18 Brumaire, Year VIII, signaled the definitive end of the revolutionary project and the beginning of a more pragmatic, authoritarian era.3 Napoleon's primary goals were to consolidate his power, pacify French society, and build an efficient empire. The calendar, a symbol of divisive radicalism, stood in the way of these objectives.

Two key factors sealed its fate. First, the Concordat of 1801, Napoleon's agreement with the Pope, restored the Catholic Church as a major institution in French life.32 This act of political reconciliation rendered the calendar's aggressive de-Christianization obsolete and politically inconvenient. Its primary

raison d'être was erased. Second, the calendar was a practical impediment to international commerce and diplomacy. In an age of expanding empire, maintaining a unique and confusing timekeeping system that required constant conversions to the universally used Gregorian calendar was simply untenable.2

Napoleon's decision to abandon the calendar was a classic example of his political pragmatism. It was a symbol of a revolution he had effectively ended. By abolishing it, he sent a powerful message of reconciliation to Catholics, simplified international relations, and removed a major source of popular grievance, all in one stroke. The calendar died because the revolutionary passion that had created it had died.

  

### Chapter 11: The Official End: The Sénatus-Consulte of 22 Fructidor, Year XIII

  

The Republican Calendar was officially abolished by a sénatus-consulte—a decree of the Napoleonic Senate—on 22 Fructidor, Year XIII (September 9, 1805).35 The decree was a model of bureaucratic brevity. Article I stated simply: "A compter du 11 nivôse prochain, 1er janvier 1806, le calendrier grégorien sera mis en usage dans tout l'Empire français" (Starting from the next 11 Nivôse, January 1, 1806, the Gregorian calendar will be put into use throughout the French Empire).35 With that, after twelve years, two months, and twenty-seven days of official use, Republican time came to an end.38

The language of the abolition decree provides a stark contrast to the poetic, philosophical language of Fabre d'Églantine's original report. The sénatus-consulte is a short, dry, administrative order, signed by figures of the new imperial establishment like the scientist Laplace.35 This linguistic shift—from the soaring poetry of utopian creation to the flat prose of imperial administration—perfectly encapsulates the trajectory of the Revolution itself. The dream of remaking the world through poetic reason had given way to the pragmatic necessities of running an empire. The poetry was over.

The calendar did, however, see a brief, ghostly revival. During the radical Paris Commune of 1871, it was resurrected for 18 days (from 16 Floréal to 3 Prairial, Year LXXIX), its use in the Journal officiel serving as a powerful symbol of continuity with the first great Parisian revolution.9

  

## Conclusion: The Echoes of a Failed Utopia

  

The French Republican Calendar stands as one of history's most profound experiments in the power of symbols. It was a grand and ambitious failure, an attempt to engineer a new consciousness by redesigning the very framework of daily experience. It failed not because it was poorly designed—indeed, its internal logic was meticulous and its poetic nomenclature possessed a unique beauty—but because it sought to unilaterally replace a temporal system that was interwoven with the deepest strands of culture, faith, and daily habit. The calendar's story proves that while a state can decree a new way of counting time, it cannot easily decree a new way of experiencing it.

As a case study in the Revolution's methods of organization, communication, and mobilization, the calendar is unparalleled. It reveals a state pioneering modern techniques of propaganda, using law, education, art, and public spectacle in a coordinated campaign to reshape the public mind. Yet its ultimate rejection by the populace serves as a powerful lesson in the limitations of top-down social engineering. It demonstrates that lasting change requires more than ideological purity and administrative power; it requires a degree of popular consent and an accommodation with the pre-existing cultural landscape that the radical phase of the Revolution was unwilling to make.

Though abolished, the calendar did not vanish. Its poetic month names—Brumaire, Thermidor, Germinal—were unforgettably attached to the pivotal events that occurred within them. They entered the permanent lexicon of history and political theory, providing a powerful shorthand for revolutionary moments. Karl Marx would analyze Napoleon III's rise in The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, and Émile Zola would title his epic novel of a miners' strike Germinal, forever associating the month of "sprouting buds" with the nascent stirrings of class consciousness.40 Ironically, the calendar, designed to control and define the memory of the Revolution, ultimately succeeded only in providing the vocabulary by which its most dramatic moments would forever be remembered.
