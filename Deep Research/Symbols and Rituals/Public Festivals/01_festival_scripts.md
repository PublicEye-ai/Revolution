# Festival Scripts Research

## Research Context:
I am conducting a comprehensive historical analysis of the French Revolution's organizational methods, communication systems, and mobilization techniques. This research aims to understand how revolutionary movements successfully transform societies through systematic organization, propaganda, and institutional reconstruction. The goal is to extract actionable historical insights about mass mobilization, network building, and social transformation.

## Research Parameters:
- Focus on specific, documented methods and techniques
- Provide primary source quotes and examples where possible
- Include dates, numbers, and measurable outcomes
- Analyze both successes and failures of each approach
- Consider how these historical methods operated in their specific context

## Current Research Phase:
This prompt is part of a systematic investigation into Symbols and Rituals - Festival Organization. Previous research has established the broad framework; now I need granular details about implementation, specific examples, and documentary evidence.

## Research Question:
Provide detailed scripts and stage directions for major revolutionary festivals.

## Desired Output Format:
Please provide:
1. Specific examples with dates and locations
2. Direct quotes from primary sources (speeches, newspapers, letters)
3. Numbers and statistics (circulation figures, membership data, participation rates)
4. Detailed procedural information (how-to guides, organizational manuals)
5. Visual descriptions (for symbols, ceremonies, printed materials)
6. Network maps and communication flows
7. Contemporary reactions and effectiveness assessments

## Research Applications:
This historical information will contribute to:
- Understanding how mass movements organize and communicate
- Analyzing the role of symbols and rituals in social transformation
- Examining how new institutions replace old ones
- Learning how ideas spread through different social strata
- Studying the relationship between ideology and practical implementation

## Note on Historical Context:
While studying these revolutionary methods, it's important to understand them within their historical context of the 1790s. This includes considering the violence and extremism that accompanied many of these techniques, as well as their ultimate outcomes. The goal is historical understanding of organizational and communication methods, not endorsement of all revolutionary actions.
