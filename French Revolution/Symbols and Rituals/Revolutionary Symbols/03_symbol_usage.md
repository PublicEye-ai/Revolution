# The Fabric of Revolution: Contested Symbols and the Battle for Citizenship in Revolutionary France, 1789-1794

  
  ![[When Red Caps and Cockades Defined a Revolution_ France's Symbol Wars.mp3]]

## Introduction

  

In the tumultuous landscape of the French Revolution, simple objects of attire—a red woolen cap, a ribbon rosette—were transformed into potent symbols of political allegiance and ideological struggle. The bonnet rouge and the tricolor cockade were not merely passive emblems of revolutionary sentiment; they became active sites of conflict, proxy battlegrounds upon which the most fundamental questions of the era were contested. The battles over their usage were, in essence, wars over the definition of the new French nation: Who constituted "the people"? What was the legitimate scope of popular political action? And what were the boundaries of citizenship, particularly concerning the volatile issues of social class and gender? This report documents and analyzes these struggles, arguing that the evolution of these symbols—from spontaneous signs of resistance to state-mandated markers of conformity, and finally to dangerous liabilities—charts the very trajectory of the Revolution itself.

The journey of these symbols from the hopeful unity of 1789, through the factional violence of the Terror, to the conservative Thermidorian Reaction reveals an inherent and ultimately irreconcilable tension between the Revolution's universalist aspirations and the exclusionary practices that came to define its most radical phase.1 The deliberate construction of a new political vocabulary, drawing on both classical ideals and working-class realities, created symbols of immense power, but also of inherent instability.4 The conflicts over who could or must wear them were not peripheral disputes over fashion but central struggles for power. They laid bare the fissures between the revolutionary government and popular movements, between Parisian militants and provincial citizens, and most starkly, between the Republic's male architects and the women who sought to claim a place within it. By documenting these battles with specific examples, primary source accounts, and legislative history, this report will demonstrate that in a revolution, nothing is "mere" symbolism; every thread and every color is woven into the fabric of the struggle itself.

## I. The Forging of Allegiance: The Genesis of Revolutionary Symbols (1789-1791)

  

The early phase of the French Revolution was marked by a conscious and deliberate effort to create a new political and national identity, distinct from the monarchical and religious symbolism of the Ancien Régime.3 This process involved the appropriation and redefinition of historical and cultural symbols to forge a new vocabulary of allegiance. The

bonnet rouge and the tricolor cockade emerged as the most potent of these new emblems, their power deriving from a carefully constructed fusion of classical republican ideals and the tangible realities of the French working class. This act of "inventing tradition" was not seamless; the very contradictions embedded within these symbols made them inherently unstable and destined for conflict from their inception.4

  

### A. The Red Cap of Liberty: A Dual Inheritance

  

The bonnet rouge, or liberty cap, drew its symbolic power from a dual inheritance that allowed it to resonate across different social strata. On one hand, it possessed a powerful intellectual legitimacy derived from classical antiquity. Educated revolutionaries and Enlightenment thinkers associated the cap with the ancient Roman pileus, a conical felt cap ceremonially placed upon the heads of freed slaves to signify their manumission.20 This link, though tenuous in direct historical terms, was firmly "established in the early modern mind" and imbued the cap with the profound concept of liberation from servitude.3 This classical allusion was further enriched by the cap's use during the Roman festival of Saturnalia, a period of sanctioned role-reversal where masters served their slaves, a fantasy that directly mirrored the revolutionary ambition to overturn the established social hierarchy.1

On the other hand, and just as importantly, the bonnet rouge was immediately recognizable to all as an "adaptation of the traditional cap of the working man".1 Its form, a simple, floppy woolen cap, was the everyday headwear of many laborers, artisans, and sailors of the Third Estate.1 This grounded the abstract, philosophical ideal of Roman

libertas in the concrete, lived experience of the common people. This dual identity was the source of its unique potency: it was simultaneously a learned symbol of republican virtue and a populist emblem of the working class, bridging the ideological gap between the bourgeois deputies of the National Assembly and the militants on the streets of Paris.1 By adopting this simple headwear, revolutionaries also subverted the tradition of "hat honor," the deferential practice whereby social inferiors were obliged to remove their hats in the presence of their superiors. To wear the

bonnet rouge was therefore an act of defiance, a visual declaration of newfound equality.1

The cap began appearing in official revolutionary iconography as early as 1790. In May of that year, it was placed upon a statue representing the nation at a Federation festival in Troyes, and later that month, it was depicted in Lyon, carried on the end of a lance by an allegorical figure of the goddess Liberty.3 These early appearances signaled its rapid adoption into the formal symbolic language of the new French state.

  

### B. The Tricolor Cockade: A Symbol of Fragile Unity

  

The tricolor cockade, the most enduring visual symbol of the Revolution, was born in the feverish days of July 1789. Its creation was a direct response to the escalating crisis in Paris. On July 12, 1789, following the dismissal of the popular finance minister Jacques Necker, the journalist Camille Desmoulins leaped onto a table at the Café de Foy and delivered an impassioned call to arms. He urged the crowd to adopt a unifying color, and they chose green, the color of hope, fashioning cockades from the leaves of the trees in the Palais-Royal gardens.5 This first symbol, however, was almost immediately discarded. The color green was also associated with the king's reactionary brother, the Comte d'Artois, making it politically untenable. This rapid rejection was the first subtle sign of how symbols were immediately contested and scrutinized for any hint of counter-revolutionary association.5

A more lasting emblem emerged the following day. The newly formed citizen militia of Paris adopted a cockade in the city's traditional colors: blue and red.3 The definitive moment came on July 17, 1789, a day of high political theater. King Louis XVI traveled from Versailles to the Hôtel de Ville in Paris to meet the new municipal government and the National Guard. There, the commander of the Guard, the Marquis de Lafayette, presented the king with a new cockade. To the blue and red of Paris, Lafayette had added a white band, the historic color of the Bourbon monarchy.7 This was a deliberate act of political engineering, an attempt "to preserve unity between the monarchy and the reformers".12 When the king pinned the tricolor cockade to his hat, it was a monumental symbolic concession, transforming an emblem of Parisian insurgency into an official national symbol of a new constitutional order.8 It was on this occasion that Lafayette reportedly made the visionary pronouncement: "Here is a cockade that will go around the world".7

  

### C. The First "Cockade War": The Versailles Banquet (October 1789)

  

The fragile unity symbolized by Lafayette's tricolor was shattered less than three months after its creation. The incident demonstrated that a symbol intended to bridge political divides could just as easily become the focal point of their violent expression. On October 1, 1789, royalist officers of the Flanders Regiment hosted a banquet for the King's Bodyguards in the opera house of the Palace of Versailles. Fueled by wine, the officers' royalist frustrations boiled over into open defiance of the Revolution.9

The tricolor cockade became the target of their rage. In what was widely reported as a deliberate act of desecration, officers trampled the revolutionary symbol underfoot. They replaced it with the white cockade of the Bourbon monarchy or the black cockade of the "Aristocratic Confederation," which represented allegiance to the Queen and the Austrian court.12 Jean-Sylvain Bailly, the mayor of Paris, recorded the scene in his memoirs, providing a vivid primary source account of the event:

*"From this moment, the banquet degenerated into an orgy. Everyone's mind became heated by...[source](https://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/550/) demonstration that ultimately forced the royal family to abandon the palace and relocate to Paris under the watchful eye of the people. The Versailles banquet thus marks the first major violent conflict explicitly triggered by a battle over symbols. It proved that these objects were not mere decorations but were invested with immense political and emotional power, capable of mobilizing thousands and altering the course of the Revolution. The attempt to create unity through a symbol had instead revealed the profound lack of it, providing a new and highly visible front for the underlying political war.

  

## II. The Sans-Culotte Uniform: Radicalization and Popular Enforcement (1792-1793)

  

As the Revolution entered a more radical phase, its symbols underwent a parallel transformation. The bonnet rouge and tricolor cockade evolved from general emblems of revolutionary sentiment into the specific, defining uniform of its most militant and uncompromising faction: the Parisian sans-culottes. This working-class movement, composed of artisans, shopkeepers, and laborers, adopted a distinctive style of dress not only to express their egalitarian ideals but also to claim political space and enforce loyalty.26 Through their use of these symbols, the

sans-culottes enacted their own vision of direct, popular sovereignty, often in direct challenge to the authority of the revolutionary government itself. This created an inevitable tension between the popular movement that had powered the Revolution and the Jacobin leadership that sought to control its direction.

  

### A. The "Quasi-Uniform" of the People's Militants

  

By 1791, the bonnet rouge had become an essential, de rigueur piece of apparel for sans-culotte militants.19 It formed the centerpiece of what historians have called a "quasi-uniform," which also included the

pantalon (long, loose-fitting trousers) and the carmagnole (a short-skirted coat).28 This attire was a conscious and powerful political statement. The very name

sans-culotte means "without knee-breeches," a direct rejection of the silk culottes worn by the aristocracy and bourgeoisie, whose restrictive tailoring signified a life of leisure, far removed from manual labor.3 By celebrating the practical clothing of the working man, the

sans-culottes visually repudiated the class hierarchy of the Ancien Régime.

This uniform became a potent signifier of the wearer's class identity, revolutionary fervor, and unwavering commitment to egalitarian principles.1 It was a simple yet profound way for the common people to "wear their politics on their sleeves," making their allegiance immediately visible to friend and foe alike.2 At the peak of their influence, even educated, bourgeois allies of the

sans-culottes, such as members of the Jacobin club, adopted this working-class fashion to demonstrate their revolutionary virtue.26

  

### B. The Humiliation of a King: The Journée of June 20, 1792

  

The power of the bonnet rouge as an instrument of popular sovereignty was dramatically demonstrated on the journée of June 20, 1792. On the third anniversary of the Tennis Court Oath, a crowd of some 8,000 armed sans-culottes marched on the Tuileries Palace. They were protesting King Louis XVI's recent veto of several key legislative measures, including one that would have established a camp of 20,000 national guardsmen (fédérés) to protect Paris from the threat of foreign invasion and internal counter-revolution.29

The demonstration culminated in a scene of extraordinary symbolic weight. The crowd surged into the palace and surrounded the king. In a moment of profound public humiliation, a municipal guard named Mouchet held out a bonnet rouge on the end of a pike. To appease the hostile crowd and demonstrate his supposed loyalty to the nation, Louis XVI "grasped it and put it on his head".10 He was then compelled to drink a toast to the health of the people.11 This act was a stunning visual enactment of the world turned upside down, a literal performance of the role-reversal fantasized in the ancient Roman festival of Saturnalia.1 The absolute monarch, the sovereign, was forced to don the cap of the freed slave. This event broadcast an unmistakable message: power no longer resided solely with the king but had been claimed by the people. The incident deeply unsettled moderates in the Legislative Assembly and further fueled radical demands for the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic.29

  

### C. "A Thousand Extravagances": The Symbol as a License for Violence

  

As the Revolution radicalized and the nation plunged into war, the meaning of the bonnet rouge continued to evolve. For the most militant sans-culottes, it transformed from a symbol of liberty into a license for intimidation and the exercise of "revolutionary justice." The streets of Paris became a theater for the enforcement of symbolic conformity. Police reports from 1792 and 1793 are filled with accounts of public disorder caused by men who called themselves the bonnets rouges.12

These individuals, emboldened by the symbol of popular power on their heads, took it upon themselves to police the patriotism of their fellow citizens. They picked quarrels with those not wearing the red cap, turning what was once a voluntary sign of inclusion into a tool of coercion.12 A contemporary police report vividly captures this shift, claiming that these

bonnets rouges "believed that they had the right to commit a thousand extravagances in the streets, in the cafes, and in the cabarets".1 This behavior represented a dark perversion of the Revolution's initial ideals. The

sans-culottes, who had adopted the cap as a symbol of their fight against oppression, were now, in the eyes of their victims, becoming "the very thing they had revolted against: the oppressors at the top of a stratified social order".1 They were enacting their own version of popular sovereignty, one that was direct, unmediated by law, and often violent.

  

### D. The Jacobin Dilemma: Taming the Popular Tiger

  

The anarchic power of the bonnet rouge and the extralegal actions of its wearers created a serious dilemma for the Jacobin leadership. The Jacobins, particularly the radical Montagnard faction, had ridden the wave of popular militancy to power, relying on the sans-culottes to overthrow the monarchy in August 1792 and purge the moderate Girondins from the National Convention in June 1793.27 Yet, once in control, they feared the very popular tiger they had unleashed.

Maximilien Robespierre, the leading figure on the Committee of Public Safety, "became wary of the bonnet rouge's power".12 His vision of revolution was one of disciplined, centralized authority, where the state held a monopoly on legitimate violence. In his seminal speech "On Political Morality" (February 5, 1794), Robespierre would articulate this philosophy, arguing that the mainspring of a revolutionary government was "at the same time [both] virtue and terror: virtue, without which terror is fatal; terror, without which virtue is impotent".18 For Robespierre, terror was "nothing but prompt, severe, inflexible justice," an "emanation of virtue" to be wielded systematically by the state, not arbitrarily by street mobs.18

The uncontrolled actions of the bonnets rouges represented a direct challenge to this vision. Their brand of popular justice was a rival claim to authority. Consequently, the Jacobin leadership took steps to rein in the symbol's power. In a move of deep irony, Robespierre and the Mayor of Paris, Jerome Pétion, successfully opposed a motion within the Jacobin Club to make the liberty cap compulsory for all speakers and members.12 This action reveals the critical fissure between the Jacobin state and the popular movement. The Jacobins were willing to embrace the

bonnet rouge as an emblem of patriotism, but they could not tolerate its use as an instrument of popular power that superseded their own authority. This foreshadowed the eventual and brutal suppression of the sans-culotte movement. Once the Jacobins had consolidated their power, they would move to eliminate their erstwhile allies, executing radical leaders like the Hébertists and dissolving the popular societies that had been the bedrock of their support.27 The battle over the symbol was a prelude to the battle for control of the Revolution itself.

  

## III. The "Cockade War": Gender, Politics, and the Fight for Public Space (1793)

  

Perhaps the most intense and revealing conflict over revolutionary symbols was the "cockade war" of 1793. This struggle, fought primarily by and between women in the streets of Paris, serves as a powerful microcosm of the larger battles over the meaning of citizenship, the role of women in the new Republic, and the ultimately rigid patriarchal limits of the Revolution. For the militant women who championed the cause, the fight to wear—and compel others to wear—the tricolor cockade was a proxy for a much larger fight for political visibility and inclusion. The violent backlash this campaign provoked, however, was cynically used by the male Jacobin leadership as a pretext to silence female political activism entirely, demonstrating how symbolic conflict could be weaponized to reassert a traditional gender order.

  

### A. The Citoyennes Claim the Cockade: The Society of Revolutionary Republican Women

  

At the forefront of this battle was the Société des Citoyennes Républicaines Révolutionnaires (Society of Revolutionary Republican Women). Founded on May 10, 1793, by the actress Claire Lacombe and the chocolate-maker Pauline Léon, the Society was a female-led political club on the far-left of the revolutionary spectrum.13 Allied with the most radical

sans-culottes and Enragés, its members were fierce patriots who demanded aggressive measures against hoarders, counter-revolutionaries, and other enemies of the Republic.13

To signify their revolutionary alliance and assert their active role, the women of the Society adopted symbols of male militancy. During their meetings, they would often wear the bonnet rouge and even trousers, consciously transgressing traditional gender norms.13 Their primary symbolic campaign, however, focused on the tricolor cockade. While a law of July 5, 1792, had already made the cockade mandatory for men, it did not apply to women.14 The Society saw this as an unacceptable exclusion. For them, compelling all women to wear the national symbol was a way to enforce loyalty to the Republic, but more fundamentally, it was a way to claim a form of active, visible citizenship. If wearing the cockade was the duty of a male citizen, then it should also be the duty—and the right—of a

citoyenne. In the summer of 1793, the Society launched an energetic petition drive, demanding that the National Convention pass a law making the cockade mandatory for all women.13

  

### B. The "Cockade War": Street Brawls and Factional Violence

  

The Society's aggressive campaign to enforce symbolic conformity spilled into the streets and markets of Paris, igniting what historian Lynn Hunt has termed a "cockade war".14 Members of the Society and other militant women took it upon themselves to enforce their political will, physically attempting to force other women, particularly the market women (

dames de la Halle), to wear the cockade.12

The resistance was immediate and violent. The market women, a powerful social group with their own distinct culture and political concerns, often opposed the price controls (the maximum) advocated by the Society and resented what they saw as an infringement on their personal liberty and an offensive "mimicry of men".13 The conflict was not just about a ribbon; it was a clash of different female subcultures and political-economic interests. Police reports from the period document numerous "vicious brawls" and public disputes over the wearing or refusal to wear the cockade.12 In some instances, women wearing black cockades—a sign of monarchist sympathies—were physically assaulted by revolutionary women who tore the offending emblems from their hats.12 The streets became a battleground where competing female factions fought over the right to define female patriotism.

  

### C. The State Intervenes: The Decree of September 21, 1793

  

As the violence and disorder escalated, the National Convention was forced to intervene. On September 21, 1793, bowing to the pressure from the petition drive initiated by the women's clubs, the Convention passed a decree that ordered all women to wear the tricolor cockade.14 The law was intended to impose unity and restore public order. It was also punitive, establishing harsh penalties for non-compliance and promising a severe punishment of up to ten years' imprisonment for any woman found guilty of "snatching away" the cockade of another.12

The outcome of this state intervention was deeply ironic. The law, designed to end the conflict, instead "provoked further violence rather than assuaged it".12 Women with counter-revolutionary or simply anti-Jacobin sympathies were now "enraged and humiliated at being forced to wear the

cocarde nationale".12 The brawls intensified, with some confrontations nearly resulting in death. A symbol that Lafayette had once hoped would express unity among all factions of French society had, through its compulsory application to women, become a catalyst for deeper and more violent division.12

  

### D. The Backlash: "Women Have No Place in Public Affairs"

  

The chaos of the "cockade war" provided the perfect opportunity for the male Jacobin leadership to address what they perceived as the underlying problem: the very existence of organized female political activism. On October 29, 1793, a deputation of women, including market women who had been harassed by militants, appeared before the Convention. They complained that members of the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women had tried to force them to wear not only the cockade but also the bonnet rouge, and they presented a petition demanding the complete suppression of the women's club.17

This petition set the stage for a decisive debate in the Convention. The deputy Philippe Fabre d'Eglantine delivered a blistering speech that masterfully pivoted from the specific issue of symbolic attire to a general condemnation of all politically active women. He framed their demands as a dangerous escalation that threatened the state:

"There have already been troubles about the cockade... you have decreed that women should wear it. Now they ask for the red cap [of liberty]. They will not rest there; they will soon demand a belt with pistols." 16

He dismissed the members of the women's clubs not as patriotic mothers and daughters but as unnatural social deviants: "adventuresses, female knights-errant, emancipated girls, and amazons".16 His speech was met with applause.

The following day, October 30, 1793, the deputy André Amar delivered the final blow. In his report for the Committee of General Security, he posed a series of rhetorical questions about women's capacity for politics, concluding that nature itself destined them for private, domestic functions, not public governance. "Are women capable of these required attentions and qualities? We can respond in general no," he argued.16 Following his report, the National Convention decreed that "clubs and popular societies of women, under whatever denomination, are forbidden".13 The battle that had begun over a piece of ribbon ended with the complete and total exclusion of women from organized political life. The Jacobin state had successfully used the conflict over symbols as a pretext to crush a female political movement it found threatening, revealing the profoundly patriarchal limits of its revolutionary vision.

  

## IV. The Ambiguity of Appearance: Conformity, Deception, and Decline

  

In the final, most radical phase of the Revolution, particularly during the Reign of Terror from 1793 to 1794, the relationship between revolutionary symbols and genuine political conviction was irrevocably severed. The state's demand for absolute, visible conformity transformed the bonnet rouge and the tricolor cockade from emblems of voluntary allegiance into masks for survival, tools for criminal behavior, and ultimately, symbols of a discredited and bloody past. This process demonstrates a fundamental paradox: the more the state tried to enforce the meaning of a symbol, the more ambiguous and unreliable that meaning became.

  

### A. The Symbol as Precaution: Wearing Loyalty for Safety

  

During the Reign of Terror, the failure to display revolutionary symbols was not merely a political statement; it was a potentially fatal omission. Anyone not wearing a cockade or, in certain contexts, a bonnet rouge, could be suspected of being a counter-revolutionary, leading to denunciation to the authorities, arrest by the local revolutionary committee, and a possible date with the guillotine.3 As a consequence, the act of wearing these symbols became, for many, a matter of pure self-preservation.

The bonnet rouge, once the proud emblem of the militant sans-culotte, was now adopted by moderates and even hidden royalists "to mask their true political leanings, lest they be denounced as aristocrats and sentenced to the guillotine".1 The symbol of liberty became a shield of deception. This created a profound disconnect between outward appearance and inner belief. A telling primary source account from an American traveler sailing to France in the mid-1790s perfectly captures this dynamic. He described his fellow passengers as having tricolor cockades

"in their pockets ready to put on"—but only once they had safely disembarked in France. For these travelers, the historian notes, the cockade was "a precaution, not a political statement".2

This compulsory usage, born of fear, inherently devalued the symbols. A symbol's power lies in its ability to signify a freely chosen identity or belief. When wearing it becomes mandatory, it no longer functions as a reliable sign of genuine allegiance. The revolutionary government's attempt to create a visually unified and patriotic citizenry through force had the paradoxical effect of rendering that visual unity meaningless.2

  

### B. The Economics of Exclusivity: The Symbol as Commodity

  

A further, deeply ironic degradation of the bonnet rouge came not from political pressure but from economic forces. As the cap became a near-ubiquitous symbol of patriotism, its popularity created a surge in demand. Merchants, seeing an opportunity for profit, began raising the price of the so-called 'bonnets of the people' to the point where they became too expensive for many of the poorest citizens to afford.12

This commodification completely subverted the cap's original meaning. An emblem intended to represent the common man and the ideal of equality was transformed by market dynamics into "another mark of exclusivity".12 The

bonnet rouge, which had begun as a symbol of "universal kinship," became an exclusionary product, accessible only to those who could pay the price. This exposed a fundamental contradiction within the revolutionary project, where the ideals of egalitarianism clashed with the realities of a nascent capitalist economy.

  

### C. The Thermidorian Reaction and the Fall from Grace

  

The final stage in the life cycle of the bonnet rouge as a revolutionary symbol came with the fall of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor, Year II (July 27, 1794). The Thermidorian Reaction that followed was a period of conservative backlash against the radicalism of the Jacobin government and the Reign of Terror. As the political tide turned against the Jacobins, the symbols inextricably linked with their rule were also condemned.19

The bonnet rouge, now tainted by its association with the guillotine and the excesses of the Terror, fell precipitously from favor. It was no longer a badge of honor but a dangerous liability. In the streets of Paris, any remaining sans-culotte who dared to wear the liberty cap was now "singled out by the young, hostile, counter-revolutionary Incroyables roaming the streets and looking to settle the score".1 These anti-Jacobin dandies, with their own extravagant style of dress, physically assaulted those still clinging to the old revolutionary uniform.

The meaning of the bonnet rouge had been completely inverted. The symbol of the patriot had become the mark of the terrorist. This final transformation powerfully illustrates the ultimate fluidity and context-dependency of political symbols. Their meaning is not inherent in the object itself but is constantly being made, unmade, and remade by the course of political events. The bonnet rouge did not fail the Revolution; the Revolution, in its radical phase, had invested the cap with a meaning so extreme that it could not survive the regime's collapse.

  

## Conclusion

  

The battles waged over the bonnet rouge and the tricolor cockade during the French Revolution were far more than superficial disputes over attire. As this report has documented, these simple objects were imbued with profound political meaning, becoming the contested ground upon which the very definition of the new French Republic was forged. The struggles over who could wear them, who must wear them, and what they signified were central to the Revolution's unfolding narrative. The trajectory of these symbols—from their hopeful and deliberately constructed origins, to their weaponization by popular movements, to their fraught legislation by a state desperate for control, and finally to their degradation into masks of conformity and markers of a discredited past—mirrors the trajectory of the Revolution itself.

The story of the bonnet rouge charts the rise and fall of the sans-culotte movement, illustrating the power of popular sovereignty and the inevitable, violent clash between a revolutionary state and the popular forces that brought it to power. The "cockade war" of 1793, in turn, serves as a stark case study of the Revolution's patriarchal limits. It reveals how militant women attempted to use symbols to claim their place as citoyennes, only to have that very conflict used as a pretext by the male leadership to expel them from the political sphere entirely. Finally, the hollowing out of these symbols' meaning during the Terror demonstrates the ultimate paradox of revolutionary governance: the attempt to enforce symbolic unity through coercion inevitably destroys the authenticity that gives symbols their power.

In the crucible of the French Revolution, a red cap was never just a cap, and a ribbon was never just a ribbon. They were the fabric of the struggle itself—visual arguments in a deadly debate over liberty, equality, and the nature of the citizen. The fierce conflicts they engendered underscore a lasting historical lesson: in times of profound social upheaval, the control of symbols is synonymous with the control of the narrative, and the battle for the narrative is the battle for power itself.
