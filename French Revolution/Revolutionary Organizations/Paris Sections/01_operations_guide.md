# The Voice of the Faubourgs: Coordination, Communication, and Political Power of the Paris Sections during the Revolutionary Journées

  
  

## Introduction

  

The great revolutionary journèes—the "days" of popular uprising that repeatedly altered the course of the French Revolution—are often depicted as spontaneous, elemental outpourings of popular fury. This report will argue that the varying efficacy of the Paris Sections during these pivotal moments was, in fact, a direct function of their sophisticated, multi-layered coordination and communication methods. The success of the insurrections of 1792-1793 was predicated on the creation of a powerful, centralized coordinating body—the Insurrectionary Commune—which fused the political will of the sections with military command. Conversely, the failure of the 1795 Prairial Uprising demonstrates the fatal consequences of the Thermidorian Convention's systematic dismantling of this very network, proving that popular revolutionary power was not merely a matter of sentiment or numbers, but of organization.

The analysis will proceed from a structural examination of the sections to a functional analysis of their communication toolkit. It will then apply this framework to three pivotal case studies: the successful insurrection of August 10, 1792; the coercive purge of the Girondins in June 1793; and the failed uprising of Prairial, 1795. This report draws heavily on primary source documents, including petitions, decrees, and eyewitness memoirs, to reconstruct the granular processes of revolutionary coordination. These materials are sourced from key digital archives such as the French Revolution Digital Archive (FRDA), which includes the Archives parlementaires, and collections from the Bibliothèque nationale de France.1

  

## I. The Anatomy of a Revolutionary Organism: Structure and Evolution of the Paris Sections

  
  

### The Legal Foundation (1790)

  

The Paris Sections were not born from revolutionary fervor but from administrative reform. By a decree of 21 May 1790, sanctioned by King Louis XVI on 27 June, the National Constituent Assembly replaced the 60 districts of Paris with 48 new territorial and administrative divisions known as "sections".3 This act provided the legal and geographical framework that would later be captured and repurposed for radical political action. Each section was endowed with a formal institutional structure: a 16-member civil committee elected by the "active citizens" of the area,

juges de paix (judges), and designated members to act as intermediaries with the central Paris Commune.3

Most critically for the events to come, this reorganization decentralized military power to the neighborhood level. Each of the 48 sections was assigned its own armed force. This typically consisted of a battalion of the National Guard, with companies of 120 to 130 men, and a dedicated company of artillery equipped with 60 men and two cannons.3 The city's entire armed force was organized into six legions, each comprising the troops from eight sections, under a single commander in chief.3 This structure, intended for municipal order, placed a significant military capability directly into the hands of local neighborhood authorities.

  

### The Radical Transformation (1792)

  

The year 1792 marked a critical turning point, as the sections evolved from administrative units into the political engine of the Parisian sans-culottes. The primary catalyst for this transformation was the Legislative Assembly's decree of 25 July 1792, which abolished the politically charged distinction between "active" citizens (men of property who could vote) and "passive" citizens (the non-propertied working class).3 This act of mass enfranchisement threw open the doors of the sectional assemblies to the artisans and laborers of Paris. As a result, the sections almost immediately declared themselves to be in "permanent session," transforming from periodic electoral bodies into constant, roiling political forums.3 They became, as described by contemporaries, the primary political organ of the

sans-culottes.3

The political impact of this change was immediate and profound. In the wake of the Brunswick Manifesto, which threatened Paris with destruction, it was the sections that drove the demand for the king's deposition. An extraordinary consensus was forged at the local level, with 47 of the 48 sections voting to demand the end of the monarchy.3 This near-unanimity demonstrated a newfound and formidable capacity for coordinated political expression, turning the administrative map of Paris into a political weapon.

The revolutionary state, in its attempt to create a rational, modern administrative structure for the capital, had inadvertently forged the very tools that would be used to challenge and ultimately overthrow the existing political order. The sections' power was not a usurpation from a vacuum but the capture and radical repurposing of state-sanctioned institutions. The monarchy and the National Assembly, seeking to rationalize Parisian governance, created the 48 sections as a tool of administration and control.3 In doing so, they endowed these units with a complete institutional apparatus: a civil committee for governance and, most critically, a dedicated armed force.3 This provided each neighborhood with a ready-made structure for mobilization. The political shift of summer 1792, particularly the decree of July 25th, flooded these structures with a new, radical constituency. This new constituency did not need to invent a new organization; they simply had to seize control of the existing one. The civil committee could become a revolutionary committee, and the sectional National Guard battalion could become a revolutionary army. The story of the sections' rise is therefore one of appropriation. The legal framework provided the container; the political radicalization of 1792 provided the explosive content.

  

## II. The Mechanisms of Insurrection: Communication and Coordination Methods

  

The power of the Paris Sections lay not just in their structure, but in their ability to communicate and coordinate action on a mass scale. They developed a sophisticated, multi-modal system that blended formal procedures with the raw energy of popular mobilization.

  

### Formal and Informal Channels

  

Communication flowed through both official and unofficial networks. Sections issued formal petitions to the Legislative Assembly and the Commune, articulating their demands and, increasingly, their ultimatums.7 These were supplemented by a constant barrage of printed material, from posters plastered on city walls publicizing upcoming demonstrations to the radical newspapers and pamphlets of figures like Jean-Paul Marat and Jacques-René Hébert, which provided ideological coherence and direction.4

The spoken word was equally vital. The political clubs, such as the Jacobins and the more radical Cordeliers, served as crucial nodes where sectional activists could debate strategy and connect with national deputies like Georges Danton and Maximilien Robespierre.5 Within the sectional assemblies themselves, powerful orators could galvanize citizens into action.11 To coordinate these disparate activities, sections sent official deputations to one another to share information and plan joint actions.9 This ad-hoc system was formalized in the summer of 1792 with the creation of a "correspondence office" at the Hôtel de Ville and, most decisively, a central committee of the provincial

fédérés and a secret directory to ensure direct contact and strategic alignment with the sections.12

  

### The Language of Mass Mobilization: Sound and Symbol

  

Beyond written and spoken words, the sections mastered a powerful language of sound and symbol to mobilize the masses. The ringing of the tocsin—the city's church bells—was the universally understood signal for alarm and insurrection. Its peal was the sonic trigger for the journèes of August 10, 1792, and May 31, 1793, representing the appropriation of a traditional civic alarm for a purely political purpose.13

A potent visual culture also emerged, creating a uniform for the revolutionary citizen that allowed for the rapid identification of friend and foe. The pike, a simple and cheap weapon, became more than just a tool of violence; it was a symbol of popular power, representing the arming of the common man against the professional armies of the old order.17 The red Phrygian cap (

bonnet rouge), an ancient symbol of freed slaves, became the ultimate emblem of liberty, while the tricolor cockade signified allegiance to the nation.17 Marchers carrying banners with slogans like "The Fatherland is in danger" transformed a crowd into a moving political statement, a visual and ideological phalanx.20

The following table provides a typology of these communication methods, illustrating the strategic sophistication with which the sections operated.

## III. The Apex of Sectional Power: The Insurrection of August 10, 1792

  

The journée of August 10, 1792, which resulted in the overthrow of the French monarchy, stands as a masterclass in coordinated revolutionary action. Far from being a spontaneous riot, it was a meticulously planned and executed coup d'état, orchestrated by the Paris Sections and their leaders. The events of that day provide a clear blueprint for how a decentralized popular movement can successfully seize state power.

  

### The Political Prelude: Manufacturing Unanimity

  

The first step was to establish overwhelming political consensus. The atmosphere in Paris was already electric, charged by the Legislative Assembly's declaration of "la patrie est en danger" ("the fatherland is in danger") and the arrival of thousands of provincial militia, the fédérés, who were petitioning for the king's removal.12 On August 3, 1792, the mayor of Paris, Jérôme Pétion, appeared before the Assembly to present a formal petition on behalf of the sections.7 This document, a key message passed from the sections to the central government, was backed by 47 of the 48 sections, creating a public display of near-total unity among the city's political organs.3 The petition was an unambiguous declaration of intent, listing the king's "misdeeds" and concluding with the stark demand: "He has separated his interests from those of the nation. We, too, separate them... we ask that he be deposed".7 This politically isolated the monarchy and legitimized future action.

  

### The Ultimatum: Setting the Clock for Insurrection

  

When the Assembly hesitated, acquitting the Marquis de Lafayette on August 8th, the sections escalated their pressure. The Quinze-Vingts section, located in the radical Faubourg Saint-Antoine, issued its famous ultimatum: if the Assembly did not pronounce the king's dethronement by midnight on August 9th, the sections would sound the tocsin and launch a direct assault on the Tuileries Palace.13 This was not a vague threat but a precise, time-bound trigger for a pre-planned military operation, creating a crisis point and a clear justification for insurrection when the deadline inevitably passed.

  

### The Coup within the Commune: Seizing the Reins of Power

  

The next step was to seize a legitimate organ of state power to serve as a command center. On the night of August 9-10, delegates from 28 of the most radical sections marched on the Hôtel de Ville, the seat of the Paris Commune.12 They declared the existing legal municipal government suspended and constituted themselves as the new "Insurrectionary Commune".4 This was a direct seizure of the city government, creating a parallel state apparatus with the authority to issue orders.

Their first and most critical act was to neutralize the opposition's military command. The Insurrectionary Commune summoned the commander of the National Guard, the loyalist Marquis de Mandat, to the Hôtel de Ville. There, he was stripped of his command, arrested, and subsequently assassinated.4 He was immediately replaced by Antoine Santerre, a brewer from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine and one of the insurrection's key leaders.4 This single, ruthless act decapitated the Tuileries' defense and placed the city's military forces under the direct command of the insurrection.

  

### Executing the Plan: Messages and Military Coordination

  

With political and military authority secured, the plan was executed. As promised, the tocsin rang out at midnight.14 The new Insurrectionary Commune directed the mobilization, with leaders like Danton and Santerre rousing their respective sections and faubourgs.12

A crucial message, preserved in eyewitness accounts, reveals the high level of strategic coordination. The Commune's procureur, Manuel, gave a direct order for the cannons on the Pont-Neuf to be withdrawn. These cannons had been placed by the loyalist Mandat precisely to prevent the armed columns from the two great radical faubourgs, Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marcel, from linking up. Manuel's justification, reported to government ministers, was explicit: "These cannon interfere with communications between the citizens of the two faubourgs. Together, they have to finish an important task today".27 This order was a conscious, strategic act to facilitate the military assault, ensuring the revolutionary forces could converge on their target. The resulting force of over 20,000 was not a mob but a coordinated army, uniting National Guard battalions from the sections, the highly motivated

fédérés from Marseille and Brest, and thousands of armed sans-culottes.14 As the historian Noah Shusterman argues, this was not a popular uprising but a planned and executed coup d'état.14

  

## IV. From Intimidation to Collapse: The Journées of 1793 and 1795

  

The trajectory of sectional power from its apex in 1792 to its final collapse in 1795 illustrates a classic cycle of revolution. A popular movement first shatters the state's monopoly on legitimate violence, but the new revolutionary state, in order to consolidate its own power, must then disarm that popular movement and re-establish a centralized monopoly on violence. The purge of the Girondins in 1793 represents the successful use of this popular power through coercion, while the Prairial Uprising of 1795 demonstrates the fatal consequences of its dismantlement.

  

### The Purge of the Girondins (31 May – 2 June 1793): Power Through Coercion

  

The journée of May 31-June 2, 1793, was not aimed at overthrowing the government but at bending it to the will of the radical Montagnard faction. It was a demonstration of power through overwhelming intimidation. Once again, the tocsin sounded, and the sections mobilized their armed forces.28 Over three days, tens of thousands of armed men, including National Guard units commanded by the radical François Hanriot, surrounded the National Convention's hall at the Tuileries Palace.5

The message was the encirclement itself. The physical containment of the national legislature by an army of sectional forces was an undeniable threat. Faced with this pressure, the centrist deputies of "the Plain" abandoned the more moderate Girondin faction. "Duly intimidated," the Convention voted for the arrest and expulsion of 29 Girondin deputies, effectively handing control of the government to the Montagnards and their Jacobin allies.10

However, the victors were, in the words of one contemporary, "uneasy".28 They had relied on direct popular coercion to achieve power, setting a dangerous precedent that could one day be turned against them. This fear of the autonomous power of the sections and the Commune led directly to the next phase of the Revolution. The new government, led by the Committee of Public Safety, began to systematically assert central control, bringing the Commune to heel, executing radical leaders like the Hébertists, and seeking to "throttle back the popular movement".5

  

### The Prairial Uprising (20-23 May 1795): The Anatomy of Failure

  

The Prairial Uprising was the final, desperate gasp of the sans-culotte movement and serves as a perfect counterpoint to the successes of 1792-93. The motivation was genuine: Parisians were starving, with bread rations falling below 60 grams per day, and they demanded "Bread and the Constitution of 1793".31 An armed crowd from the faubourgs invaded the Convention and murdered the deputy Jean-Bertrand Féraud, but the action was chaotic and lacked strategic direction.31

The failure was a direct result of the systematic destruction of the sections' coordinating infrastructure.

- No Central Command: The Insurrectionary Commune, the organizational brain of the 1792 and 1793 uprisings, had been abolished following the Thermidorian Reaction.33 There was no central body to plan strategy or direct forces.
    
- Internal Division: Unlike the near-unanimity of August 1792, the sections were now deeply divided. Several sections remained loyal to the Thermidorian Convention, and the National Guard was split, with units from the wealthier western districts actively siding with the government.31
    
- Lack of Leadership: The charismatic and ruthless leaders of the earlier journèes—Danton, Marat, Hébert, Robespierre—were all dead.33 The movement was demoralized and leaderless.
    
- Decisive State Response: The Thermidorian Convention did not hesitate. It declared a state of siege and, for the first time, relied heavily on the regular army to suppress a popular uprising in Paris. General Jacques de Menou commanded 20,000 troops who surrounded the rebel faubourgs and systematically disarmed them with little resistance.31 The account of General Kilmaine, who led forces against the insurgents, highlights the firmness of the military and the disorganization of the rebels, whom he described as a "horde" that was ultimately ineffective against disciplined soldiers.35
    

The repression that followed was brutal and definitive. Militants were arrested, dozens were executed, and the sans-culottes were purged from the National Guard. After a final royalist uprising in Vendémiaire (October 1795), the sectional assemblies themselves were abolished, permanently ending their political role.33 The era of popular insurrection in Paris was over, crushed by the very state it had helped create.

  

## V. Conclusion: The Legacy of Sectional Coordination

  

The political trajectory of the Parisian popular movement during the French Revolution was inextricably linked to the life cycle of its unique coordination mechanisms. The analysis of the major journèes reveals that the power of the sans-culottes was not an abstract force of popular will but a concrete function of political and military organization. The administrative creation of the 48 sections provided the structure, the political radicalization of 1792 provided the motive, and the formation of the Insurrectionary Commune provided the unified command that allowed popular sentiment to be translated into irresistible force.

The Paris Sections represent one of history's most radical and effective experiments in direct, participatory democracy at a mass scale. Their ability to coordinate petitions, propaganda, and ultimately armed force allowed ordinary citizens to exert decisive influence over national events. However, this decentralized power was inherently unstable and proved threatening to any form of centralized state, even a revolutionary one. The Jacobin government, having used the sections to eliminate its rivals, immediately began the process of re-centralizing authority and dismantling the very organs of popular power that had brought it to victory. The Thermidorian Reaction merely completed this process.

The ultimate lesson from the coordination methods of the Paris Sections is that revolutionary power is a function of organization. The sans-culottes were not defeated when their anger subsided or their cause became less just, but when their institutions were destroyed. The story of their methods of communication and coordination—of their petitions and committees, their tocsins and pikes—is therefore the story of the rise and fall of popular sovereignty itself during the French Revolution. It leaves a dual legacy: an inspiration for future popular movements on the potential of grassroots organization, and a stark cautionary tale about the enduring power of the centralized state to reassert its monopoly on violence.
