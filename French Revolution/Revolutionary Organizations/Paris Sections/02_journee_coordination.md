## Introduction

  

The French Revolution was punctuated by a series of pivotal days of popular uprising, or journées, that repeatedly and decisively altered its course. These events, often characterized by massive crowds, armed force, and dramatic political consequences, drove the revolution from its initial phase of constitutional monarchy toward the radical republic of 1793. A superficial reading of these moments might suggest they were little more than spontaneous, chaotic outpourings of popular fury, driven by hunger and desperation. However, a more rigorous historical analysis reveals a far more complex and sophisticated reality. The major journées of 10 August 1792 and 31 May–2 June 1793 were not simply uncontrolled riots. Instead, they were increasingly well-planned and coordinated political operations, orchestrated through a powerful, symbiotic, and ultimately hierarchical synergy between the Jacobin leadership (specifically the Montagnard faction), the institutional power of the Paris Commune, the grassroots mobilization of the 48 sectional assemblies, and the armed force of the sans-culottes, who had progressively co-opted the National Guard.

This report will argue that these events represent the perfection of a new form of political action, where popular discontent was strategically channeled into a weapon to achieve specific, predetermined political outcomes. The Jacobins and their allies did not merely react to popular anger; they learned to cultivate, direct, and deploy it. This was achieved through a multi-layered organizational infrastructure that linked the ideological debates of the Paris clubs to the administrative power of the city government and the militant energy of the streets. It was amplified by a mastery of propaganda, oratory, and symbolism that created a unified political will, defined a crisis, identified an enemy, and directed mass action toward a precise goal. By examining the organizational structures, the methods of mobilization, and the detailed execution of the two most significant journées of the radical phase, this analysis will reveal the anatomy of a new and formidable model of revolutionary coordination that forever changed the nature of political power.

  

## Chapter I. The Revolutionary Engine: Organizational Structures of Power

  

The success of the revolutionary journées was not accidental; it was predicated on a complex and robust organizational infrastructure. The Jacobins' ability to shape the course of the revolution stemmed from their influence over, and eventual direction of, a multi-layered network of political and military bodies. Each component of this revolutionary engine—the national club network, the Paris city government, the local neighborhood assemblies, and the armed citizenry—played a distinct yet complementary role. Together, they formed an interlocking system that could translate ideological fervor into coordinated, decisive action.

  

### The Jacobin Club: The National Brain Trust

  

The Jacobin Club's evolution from a small debating society into a vast national political machine was central to the coordination of the revolution.1 Originating in 1789 as the Club Breton, a caucus for anti-royalist deputies, it rapidly expanded after moving to Paris.1 Initially admitting prosperous bourgeois and men of letters, the club's membership and influence grew exponentially.2 By July 1790, the Parisian "mother society" boasted 1,200 members and was connected to 152 affiliate clubs across France.2 This network exploded in response to counter-revolutionary threats, and by its peak in 1793, it comprised an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 clubs with a nominal membership of half a million citizens.2 This immense structure transformed the Jacobins into a veritable "bureau for French republicanism".1

The power of this network lay in its centralized and hierarchical nature, inspired in part by British radical societies with which it corresponded.4 The Paris club served as the undisputed ideological and strategic hub. Its formal rules, adopted in February 1790, explicitly provided for the admission of affiliated societies and the maintenance of a "regular correspondence" with them.1 This correspondence network was the nervous system of the revolution, allowing the Jacobins in Paris to disseminate a unified political line, circulate propaganda, share strategies, and keep their provincial counterparts informed of events in the capital.6 Under the Law of 14 Frimaire (4 December 1793), this network was officially enlisted by the government to monitor local officials, nominate new appointees, and act as "arsenals of public opinion," effectively institutionalizing its role as an arm of the state.8

After the flight of the king in June 1791 and the subsequent split with moderate monarchists, the Jacobin Club became the exclusive domain of republicans, and later, of the most radical faction, the Montagnards, led by figures like Maximilien Robespierre.5 The club's meetings in Paris became the primary venue for "radical and rousing oratory" that pushed for the key goals of the radical revolution.1 It was here that the strategies for the great

journées were debated, refined, and legitimized before being transmitted to the other organs of the movement. For example, Robespierre repeatedly used the Jacobin Club as his platform to call for the creation of a revolutionary army of sans-culottes and, most decisively, to issue the call for an insurrection against the rival Girondin faction in May 1793.11

  

### The Paris Commune: The Insurrectionary State

  

If the Jacobin Club was the brain of the revolution, the Paris Commune was its administrative heart, which, at critical moments, transformed into an insurrectionary command center. Established in the wake of the storming of the Bastille, the Commune was the municipal government of Paris.13 A reorganization in the spring of 1790 divided the city into 48 revolutionary sections, each equipped with its own civil committee, revolutionary committee, and popular militia.13 These sections, initially focused on local civic matters, became increasingly politicized and radicalized, serving as the direct link between the city government and the sans-culottes.13

The Commune's decisive transformation occurred in 1792. Dominated by Jacobins such as Georges Danton, Camille Desmoulins, and Jacques Hébert—many of whom were barred from the Legislative Assembly by a self-denying ordinance—the Commune became a revolutionary counter-power to the national government.13 The critical moment came on the night of 9 August 1792, when a new "revolutionary Commune," led by these Jacobin firebrands, seized control of the Hôtel de Ville.13 This act was not a spontaneous riot but a calculated coup that turned the entire apparatus of city government into an openly insurrectionary body, refusing all orders from the central government and paving the way for the attack on the Tuileries Palace the next day.13

During the journées, the Commune functioned as the operational headquarters for the insurrection. It possessed and exercised the authority to implement key tactical measures: closing the city gates to trap enemies and prevent escape, sounding the tocsin from the bell towers to signal the mobilization, ordering the arrest of political opponents, and, most importantly, appointing and directing the commander of the Paris National Guard.12 During the purge of the Girondins in May-June 1793, it was the Commune, guided by a special insurrectionary committee, that dictated the measures to be taken, appointed the sans-culotte leader François Hanriot as sole commander of the Guard, and gave him the explicit order to march on the National Convention and not to withdraw until the "traitorous" deputies were surrendered.12

  

### The 48 Sections: The Grassroots Mobilizers

  

The 48 Parisian sections were the crucibles of the revolution, the primary forums where the abstract ideology of the Jacobins was translated into the concrete demands and actions of the people. They were the epicenters of direct democracy, where the sans-culottes—the artisans, shopkeepers, and laborers—participated directly in the political process.13 While they served as intermediaries between the populace and the Commune, the sections also jealously guarded their own power, at times claiming to have "resumed their sovereignty" from all other authorities.15

Far from being passive recipients of orders, the sections were often the initiators of the journées. The insurrection of 10 August 1792 was formally triggered by an ultimatum issued from the Quinze-Vingts section, which declared that if the king were not dethroned by midnight, the sections would sound the tocsin and launch an assault on the Tuileries Palace.15 This ultimatum, supported by 47 of the 48 sections, provided the political pretext and the precise timeline for the coordinated action that followed. Similarly, the insurrection against the Girondins was launched when delegates from 33 of the most radical sections met at the Bishop's Palace (

Évêché) and declared themselves in a state of insurrection, forming their own central committee to lead the revolt.12

This process created a powerful feedback loop of radicalization. Jacobin leaders attended and spoke at sectional meetings, shaping the debate. The sections would then pass resolutions reflecting Jacobin rhetoric, which were framed as the authentic "will of the people." The Jacobin-controlled Commune would then legitimize these sectional demands and provide the administrative and military resources to carry them out.13 This dynamic allowed the Jacobins to present their political agenda not as the will of a faction, but as the sovereign demand of the Parisian populace itself.

  

### The Sans-Culottes and the National Guard: The Armed Fist

  

The sans-culottes were the "driving popular force behind the revolution" and the militants who formed its striking arm.11 Comprising urban laborers, artisans, and small shopkeepers, their political engagement was fueled by acute economic distress. Their most pressing demands were for affordable food (particularly bread), fixed wages, and the punishment of "hoarders" and "speculators" whom they blamed for their misery.9 They were the activists who populated the paramilitary forces, who marched on the Convention, and who carried out the physical acts of insurrection.11

The Jacobins' ability to harness this force was perhaps their greatest strategic achievement. A persistent demand, articulated by Robespierre in the Jacobin Club and echoed in the sections, was the arming of the sans-culottes.11 Robespierre repeatedly called for the creation of a paid revolutionary army of 20,000 to 40,000 men, funded by a tax on the rich, to serve as a permanent defense against the revolution's internal enemies.11 This vision was realized in stages, culminating in the official establishment of a paid armed force of 6,000 men and 1,000 gunners in September 1793, a formal

armée révolutionnaire designed to enforce revolutionary laws.11

Crucially, this popular force was integrated with an official military body: the National Guard. Originally formed in 1789 as a bourgeois militia to maintain order, the Guard was progressively "democratized" as its ranks filled with sans-culottes.21 By 1792, the loyalty of the National Guard had become the "determining factor" in the success or failure of any revolutionary action.24 The Jacobin-led Commune cemented its control over this force through decisive action. On the eve of the August 10 insurrection, they orchestrated the assassination of the loyalist Guard commander, Mandat, and replaced him with the popular brewer and Jacobin ally, Antoine Santerre.13 In May 1793, they appointed another sans-culotte leader, François Hanriot, to the command.12 Under these new leaders, the National Guard was transformed from a guardian of the establishment into the primary instrument of insurrection, used to besiege and coerce the National Convention itself.11

The Jacobins' power did not reside in a single organization but in their creation of an informal yet highly effective "interlocking directorate" that spanned four key domains: ideological (the Club), municipal (the Commune), grassroots (the Sections), and military (the Sans-Culottes/National Guard). Key figures like Robespierre, Danton, and Hébert operated seamlessly across these spheres. A political objective, such as the removal of the Girondins, would be conceived and debated in the Jacobin Club. It would then be articulated as a popular demand in the sectional assemblies. The Commune would then provide the official sanction and logistical support—closing the city gates, appointing a loyal commander. Finally, the National Guard, filled with and led by sans-culottes, would execute the physical action. This integrated structure—a brain, a nerve center, and a muscular arm working in unison—was far more powerful and sophisticated than any single element acting alone and explains the escalating effectiveness of the journées of 1792 and 1793.

Furthermore, the Jacobins cemented this critical alliance with the sans-culottes by strategically abandoning their original laissez-faire economic principles in favor of interventionist policies that directly addressed the material grievances of the urban poor.9 While the Girondins steadfastly defended free markets, even in the face of widespread hunger, the Jacobins embraced price controls, most notably the Law of the General Maximum.9 This was a political masterstroke. It allowed them to portray the Girondins as indifferent elitists and enemies of the people, thereby harnessing the raw power of popular hunger for their own political end: the elimination of a rival faction. The purge of the Girondins in June 1793 was immediately followed by the enactment of the General Maximum, cementing the quid pro quo that bound the people's "armed fist" to the Jacobin political will.13

## Chapter II. The Arsenal of Persuasion: Methods of Mobilization

  

The organizational "hardware" of the revolution—the clubs, the Commune, the sections, and the Guard—was animated by sophisticated "software." The Jacobins and their allies employed a range of techniques to create a unified political will, define a state of crisis, demonize their opponents, and direct mass action toward a specific goal. Through oratory, the press, potent symbols, and clear signals, they constructed an environment where insurrection appeared not only justified but as the highest expression of patriotic duty.

  

### The Power of the Podium: Oratory as a Call to Arms

  

The spoken word was a primary weapon in the Jacobin arsenal. Leaders used the platforms of the Jacobin Club and the National Convention to frame political disputes as existential threats to the very survival of the Revolution. Robespierre was a master of this technique, consistently portraying his political opponents not as colleagues with differing opinions, but as conspirators and traitors to liberty.12 In his speeches leading up to the purge of the Girondins, he methodically linked them to the treason of General Dumouriez, concluding with a dramatic call for the "prosecution of all Dumouriez's accomplices," a list that conveniently included his chief political rivals.12 This rhetoric transformed a factional dispute into a matter of national security.

As a crisis ripened, this oratory shifted from theoretical debate to explicit calls for armed action. On 26 May 1793, Robespierre stood before the Jacobin Club and openly summoned the people "to place themselves in insurrection against corrupt deputies".12 Two days later, he took this message directly to the insurrectionary Commune at the Hôtel de Ville, repeating his call for an "armed insurrection" and declaring, "If the Commune does not unite closely with the people, it violates its most sacred duty".12 These were not vague suggestions; they were direct instructions from the revolution's most authoritative voice to its key organizational bodies.

This mobilizing rhetoric reached its zenith in moments of extreme peril. Danton's legendary speech to the Legislative Assembly on 2 September 1792, as Prussian armies advanced on Paris, is a masterclass in turning fear into revolutionary energy. His declarations that "All are stirred, all are excited, all burn to fight," and his immortal climax, "To conquer them we must dare, dare again, always dare, and France is saved!" served as a powerful incitement to action.27 The speech, which called for the punishment of anyone refusing to serve or furnish arms, directly preceded the September Massacres, demonstrating the potent and often violent consequences of such powerful oratory.13

  

### The Revolutionary Press: Engineering Public Opinion

  

The revolution unleashed an unprecedented explosion of print media, which became a vital tool for engineering public opinion on a mass scale. Between 1789 and 1797, over 1,300 new newspapers appeared, with the daily circulation in Paris alone reaching 130,000 by 1791.29 The impact of these papers was magnified by the common practice of reading them aloud in public squares, cafés, and political clubs, with each copy estimated to have reached the ears of ten people.29 This created a vast new audience for political information and propaganda.

Radical newspapers became the dedicated mouthpieces of the revolutionary movement. Jean-Paul Marat's L'Ami du peuple (The Friend of the People) was the quintessential voice of the sans-culottes, a "watchdog" that relentlessly exposed supposed "traitors," denounced conspiracies, and called for violent purges to save the revolution.29 Similarly, Jacques Hébert's

Le Père Duchesne adopted the "coarse, raging voice of the sans-culottes," using profane and aggressive language to denounce enemies.33 By 1793, it was being distributed to soldiers at the front, spreading the radical message beyond Paris.29 These papers were instrumental in creating a shared narrative of the revolution, identifying a common enemy, and circulating calls to action.34

Alongside newspapers, pamphlets served as a crucial medium, particularly for reaching a population with varying levels of literacy.35 Often featuring satirical caricatures that mocked the monarchy, clergy, and aristocracy, these pamphlets translated the complex Enlightenment philosophies of liberty and equality into simple, powerful messages that resonated with the common people.35 The vast network of Jacobin clubs across France served as the primary distribution centers for this propaganda, functioning as "strongholds of republicanism" that actively shaped public opinion at the local level.34

  

### The Symbolism of Revolution: Forging a Collective Identity

  

In a period of profound social upheaval and shifting allegiances, simple visual symbols became a vital means of forging a collective identity and instantly demarcating patriot from enemy. The tricolor cockade, born on the eve of the storming of the Bastille, was the first and most enduring of these symbols.37 A circular pleat of blue, white, and red ribbon, it combined the traditional colors of Paris (blue and red) with the royal white, initially symbolizing a union of the people and the king.37 Pinned to a hat, it quickly became the mandatory emblem of patriotism.38

As the revolution radicalized, the bonnet rouge, or Phrygian cap, emerged as a more potent symbol of republican liberty.38 This soft, red, conical cap was deliberately drawn from the ancient Roman

pileus, a cap given to freed slaves to mark their liberation.38 Worn ubiquitously by the sans-culottes, it was a clear sign of allegiance to the radical cause.33 During the Reign of Terror, its power was such that even aristocrats and moderates adopted it in a desperate attempt to avoid the guillotine.39

This symbolic language was also deployed in more elaborate forms. The revolutionary leadership enlisted prominent artists like Jacques-Louis David to serve as de facto "creative directors".40 David and others organized massive revolutionary festivals and produced powerful works of neoclassical art that celebrated republican virtues like patriotic sacrifice for the state.40 These state-sponsored cultural events served a dual purpose: they gave symbolic expression to the popular desire for justice while also serving to "order and discipline the crowd," channeling their energies into officially sanctioned forms of expression.40

  

### The Signals of Insurrection: Tactical Coordination

  

When persuasion and symbolism had prepared the ground, specific, universally understood signals were used to launch the physical mobilization for a journée. The most important of these was the sounding of the tocsin—the continuous, urgent ringing of alarm bells from the city's church towers, most notably the great bell of the Notre-Dame Cathedral.12 This ancient signal for danger and call to arms could be heard across Paris, instantly alerting the sections and the populace that the insurrection had begun. On the night of 9 August 1792, and again on 31 May 1793, the tocsin served as the revolution's starting gun.

The tocsin was often accompanied by the firing of an alarm cannon. During the May 1793 insurrection, a cannon was fired from the Pont-Neuf as a signal of alarm.16 The sound of this artillery carried a message of its own. As Danton declared to the Convention on May 31, "You have heard the thunder of the cannon," using the sound as a direct threat to intimidate the deputies into compliance.16 Together, the tocsin and the alarm cannon were the tactical triggers that transformed a state of readiness into a mass movement, rapidly gathering crowds and armed units from across the sprawling city to converge on their target.

The Jacobins did not simply issue orders; they meticulously crafted a totalizing environment of persuasion where insurrection became the only logical and patriotic response to a perceived crisis. This was achieved through the creation of a closed-loop information ecosystem. A speech by Robespierre in the Jacobin Club would be reported and amplified in L'Ami du peuple. The "traitors" he named would be depicted as enemies in caricatures distributed by the clubs. The call to action would be symbolized by the wearing of the bonnet rouge. The final signal to act would be the tolling of the tocsin. For a Parisian sans-culotte, every sensory input—what they heard in the street, what was read to them from a pamphlet, the hat their neighbor wore, the bell they heard tolling—reinforced the same message: the Fatherland is in danger, here are the enemies, it is your duty to rise. This "semantic environment" blurred the line between persuasion and coercion, making dissent appear not as a political disagreement but as a betrayal of the patrie.

This process involved the deliberate transformation of the revolution's core concepts. The idea of "virtue" (vertu), for example, was semantically re-engineered from a lofty Enlightenment ideal of civic humanism into a flexible, populist justification for political violence. Early revolutionary rhetoric, reflected in David's neoclassical paintings like The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons, focused on a "classical virtue" of stoic, patriotic sacrifice for the state.41 As the revolution radicalized, Jacobin propagandists like Marat promoted a more emotional "natural virtue"—a passionate, all-consuming commitment to defending the fatherland and mercilessly rooting out its enemies.41 This new definition of virtue was deliberately ambiguous and could be used to legitimize any action taken to preserve Jacobin power. Robespierre made this connection explicit, declaring that in a revolution, the basis of government is "both virtue and terror: virtue, without which terror is monstrous; terror, without which virtue is impotent".41 In this formulation, terror became the active, necessary expression of virtue. This transformation of language provided the ideological cover for the purges carried out during the

journées, making extreme actions not only palatable but morally imperative.

  

## Chapter III. Case Study I: The Overthrow of the Monarchy (10 August 1792)

  

The journée of 10 August 1792 stands as a watershed moment in the French Revolution. It marked the definitive end of the constitutional monarchy and the birth of the republic. More than a simple protest, it was the first fully coordinated operation of the Jacobin-Commune apparatus, demonstrating a clear evolution from popular demonstration to planned, armed insurrection. Its success was the result of meticulous political and military planning that harnessed popular anger to achieve a specific, revolutionary goal.

  

### The Catalyst and the Plan

  

The summer of 1792 was a period of escalating crisis. A deep and irreconcilable conflict had developed between King Louis XVI and the Legislative Assembly. The King repeatedly used his constitutional veto to block key legislation, including decrees to deport non-juring priests and, most critically, to establish a camp of 20,000 provincial soldiers, or fédérés, near Paris for the city's defense.15 This political stalemate was supercharged on 1 August 1792, when news reached Paris of the Brunswick Manifesto. This proclamation by the commander of the invading Austro-Prussian army threatened the people of Paris with "unforgettable vengeance" should any harm befall the royal family.15 Rather than intimidating the revolutionaries, the manifesto was seen as proof of the king's collusion with the enemy, creating a state of emergency and dramatically accelerating plans for insurrection.

In this febrile atmosphere, the Jacobin-dominated political clubs became the centers for planning the monarchy's overthrow.15 The strategy that emerged, as later described by the historian François Mignet, was a clear, multi-step political and military operation: first, dissolve the existing, moderate departmental government of Paris; second, dismiss the mayor, Jérôme Pétion; third, institute a new, insurrectionary Commune; and finally, launch a direct assault on the Tuileries Palace, the king's residence.15

The plan was set in motion by the grassroots power of the sections. On 8 August, the Quinze-Vingts section, one of the most radical in the city, issued a formal ultimatum to the Legislative Assembly: if the dethronement of the king was not pronounced by midnight on August 9, they would sound the tocsin and lead an armed attack on the palace. This demand was swiftly endorsed by 47 of the 48 Parisian sections, providing the insurrection with a powerful mandate of popular sovereignty and a clear deadline for action.15

  

### Coordination in Motion: The Night of August 9-10

  

As the ultimatum expired, the revolutionary engine roared to life with remarkable precision. The first and most critical step was the seizure of the municipal government. On the night of August 9, a new "revolutionary Paris Commune," led by prominent Jacobins including Danton, Desmoulins, and Hébert, took possession of the Hôtel de Ville.13 This bloodless coup placed the entire administrative and military apparatus of the capital in the hands of the insurrection's leaders.

The new Commune's first act was to neutralize the defense of the Tuileries. They summoned the commander of the Paris National Guard, the Marquis de Mandat, a staunch constitutional monarchist, to the Hôtel de Ville. There, he was accused of plotting against the people, summarily executed, and replaced with Antoine Joseph Santerre, a brewer from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine and a loyal Jacobin ally.13 This decisive action decapitated the palace's command structure, sowed confusion among the defending forces, and ensured that a significant portion of the National Guard would either actively join the insurrection or stand aside when the attack came.24

With the command structure secured, the mobilization of the attack force began. The tocsin rang out from bell towers across the city, the pre-arranged signal for the sections to assemble their armed members.24 The revolutionary army that converged on the Tuileries was a potent combination of forces: battalions of the Paris National Guard, now under Santerre's command; the highly motivated

fédérés from Marseille and Brittany, who had been brought to Paris for precisely this purpose; and thousands of armed sans-culottes from the sections.15 This combined force, estimated at over 20,000 strong, was far more than a disorganized mob.43 First-hand accounts describe disciplined columns of armed citizens and National Guardsmen marching in formation, dragging cannons into position on the bridges overlooking the palace.44

  

### The Assault and its Aftermath

  

Faced with this overwhelming and organized force, the defense of the palace crumbled. The King, realizing that his own cannoneers had treacherously unloaded their weapons and that Mandat was gone, fled with his family across the gardens to the nearby Legislative Assembly, seeking refuge with the very body his vetoes had paralyzed.18 Shortly after his departure, the assault began. The battle was brief but exceptionally bloody, pitting the revolutionary forces against the palace's last line of defense, the Swiss Guards. The Swiss, fighting with discipline, initially repelled the attackers, but were eventually overwhelmed by sheer numbers. The King's belated written order for them to lay down their arms and retire to their barracks proved to be a death sentence; as they attempted to disengage, they were surrounded in the palace gardens and slaughtered. The battle resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Swiss Guards and approximately 400 revolutionaries, making it the bloodiest

journée of the Revolution.15

The military victory was immediately and decisively translated into political power. The Legislative Assembly, now effectively a prisoner of the insurrectionary Commune, was forced to suspend the king and agree to the election of a new body, the National Convention, by universal male suffrage.13 The Commune, now the de facto government of France, demanded and received custody of the royal family, imprisoning them in the Temple fortress. Robespierre, elected as a representative to the new Commune, presented a petition to the Assembly demanding the establishment of a special Revolutionary Tribunal to try the "traitors" and "enemies of the people" who had defended the monarchy.13 Six weeks later, on 21 September 1792, the newly convened National Convention, a direct product of the

journée, formally abolished the monarchy. The next day, the French First Republic was proclaimed.15

While the journée of August 10 involved a massive popular mobilization, its success ultimately hinged on a meticulously planned and executed military and political coup. The key actions were not spontaneous riots but calculated strategic maneuvers: the seizure of the municipal government, the targeted assassination of the loyalist military commander, his replacement with a revolutionary loyalist, and the disciplined deployment of organized military units equipped with artillery.13 The planners did not rely on popular anger alone; they focused on neutralizing the enemy's command and control and securing the loyalty of armed units. The event should therefore be understood as a sophisticated coup d'état that harnessed popular support as its primary force multiplier, but was ultimately decided by superior military and political coordination—a model far removed from a simple bread riot.

A crucial element of this strategy was the use of the fédérés as a revolutionary Trojan Horse. The Jacobins and their allies in the Assembly had strategically used the pretext of the external war with Austria to justify bringing thousands of loyal, republican provincial soldiers to Paris.15 The King's veto of this measure only served to heighten its importance and fuel the crisis. When the

fédérés, particularly the disciplined and zealous contingent from Marseille, arrived in the capital, they formed the hard-bitten, military core of the insurrectionary army.43 This was a long-term strategy: using the external war as a justification to build an internal army with the specific political objective of overthrowing the King. The

fédérés were the key that shifted the military balance of power in Paris and made the assault on the Tuileries possible.

  

## Chapter IV. Case Study II: The Purge of the Girondins (31 May – 2 June 1793)

  

The insurrection of 31 May–2 June 1793 represents the perfection of the Jacobin model of the revolutionary journée. The methods honed in the assault on the monarchy were now turned inward, deployed with ruthless efficiency as a tool for one revolutionary faction to eliminate another. This event was not a struggle against the Ancien Régime, but a calculated purge within the Republic itself, demonstrating that the combination of popular mobilization and armed coercion could be used to seize control of the national legislature and redefine the course of the Revolution.

  

### The Road to Confrontation

  

By the spring of 1793, the French Republic was facing an existential crisis on multiple fronts. The economy was in freefall; the value of the assignat, the revolutionary paper currency, had collapsed to as little as 36 percent of its face value, while the cost of basic necessities had roughly doubled. This led to widespread hunger and a profound disillusionment among the menu peuple, who felt they had gained nothing from four years of revolution.47 On the battlefield, French armies suffered a series of defeats, and the defection of General Dumouriez to the Austrians shattered confidence in the military leadership.47 Compounding these external threats was a massive internal one: a huge royalist and Catholic revolt had erupted in the Vendée region, threatening major cities and descending much of western France into a brutal civil war.45

These compounding crises dramatically sharpened the bitter political conflict between the two leading factions in the National Convention: the Montagnards and the Girondins.47 The Girondins, who held a majority and controlled the government ministries, were widely blamed for the military failures and the economic chaos.16 Their steadfast commitment to free-market principles led them to oppose the economic demands of the Parisian sans-culottes, particularly the call for a "maximum" (price controls on bread and other essentials).25 They also fiercely denounced the growing power of the radical Paris Commune, a stance that exposed them to accusations of "federalism"—a desire to weaken the central authority of Paris in favor of the provinces.49 The Girondins' political position became untenable after they orchestrated the prosecution of the radical journalist Jean-Paul Marat. His triumphant acquittal in April 1793 was a disastrous miscalculation that turned him into a popular hero and galvanized his supporters for a final confrontation.25

  

### The Jacobin Response and Coordination

  

Faced with what they portrayed as Girondin incompetence and treason, the Jacobin leadership moved to orchestrate their removal. On 26 May 1793, Maximilien Robespierre mounted the tribune of the Jacobin Club and delivered a decisive speech that served as the formal call to arms. He summoned the people "to place themselves in insurrection against the corrupt deputies" of the Girondin faction, providing the "moral" justification for the impending purge.12

The operational planning for this insurrection was more centralized and sophisticated than that of the previous August. The initiative was taken by a special insurrectionary committee formed by delegates from 33 of the most radical Parisian sections, who met at the Évêché (the Bishop's Palace).12 This committee, which included well-known agitators like Jean-François Varlet and Claude-Emmanuel Dobsen, declared the city in a state of insurrection and worked in direct coordination with the Paris Commune to plan the uprising.12

The first attempt at insurrection, launched on Friday, May 31, proved to be a partial failure. While the armed crowds succeeded in intimidating the Convention into suppressing the Girondin-led Commission of Twelve, they failed to achieve their primary objective: the arrest of the Girondin leaders.12 The mobilization was smaller than anticipated, as many of the sans-culottes were at their jobs.16 This misstep led to recriminations among the radical leadership, with Varlet accusing the organizers of weakness. However, the failure was treated not as a defeat but as a crucial learning experience. The insurrectionary committee resolved to prepare a more overwhelming "supplement" to the revolution for Sunday, June 2—a day of rest when they could guarantee the maximum participation of the sans-culottes and ensure the display of force would be too intimidating to resist.12

  

### The Siege of the Convention (June 2)

  

On Sunday, June 2, the perfected plan was executed with military precision. The Commune ordered François Hanriot, the recently appointed sans-culotte commander of the National Guard, to surround the National Palace at the Tuileries, where the Convention held its sessions.12 An overwhelming force, with estimates ranging from 30,000 to as many as 100,000 armed men, composed of National Guard battalions and sans-culottes, encircled the building, supported by a formidable park of artillery numbering between 48 and 172 cannons.11 The national legislature was now a hostage.

The deputies were trapped and subjected to direct intimidation. When a delegation of deputies, led by the Convention's president, attempted to exit the building to remonstrate with the troops, they were met by Hanriot on horseback. He contemptuously refused them passage and, in a moment of high drama, gave the order to his gunners, "Canonniers, a vos pieces!" ("Cannoneers, to your guns!"), aiming the artillery directly at the representatives of the nation.12

Faced with this undeniable and direct military threat, the Convention's resistance collapsed. The deputies were forced back into their hall, where, under the duress of Hanriot's cannons, they capitulated completely. On a motion by the Jacobin Georges Couthon, a close ally of Robespierre, the Convention voted for the arrest of 29 of the most prominent Girondin deputies and two government ministers.12 The Girondin faction was annihilated as a political force. The

journée had succeeded, not through debate or popular acclamation, but through the "intimidation" and armed coercion of the sovereign national assembly.52

  

### A Contested Narrative: Jacobin vs. Girondin Accounts

  

The events of May-June 1793 were immediately subject to two irreconcilable interpretations. The Jacobins and their allies portrayed the journée as a legitimate and necessary act of popular sovereignty. In their narrative, they were simply enacting the will of the people to remove treacherous, "federalist" deputies who were conspiring with foreign and domestic enemies and were responsible for the nation's crises.12

The Girondins, in contrast, saw themselves as the victims of an illegal and violent coup d'état, orchestrated by their Montagnard rivals and carried out by the Parisian mob.25 Their leader, Maximin Isnard, had earlier threatened that if Paris were to harm the nation's representatives, the provinces of France would rise up and destroy the city in retaliation.12 This belief in their provincial support proved to be their final hope; after the purge, many of the proscribed deputies who escaped arrest fled to cities like Caen, Bordeaux, and Lyon to try and organize the "Federalist Revolts" against the new Montagnard-controlled Convention.48 The final, defiant words of the Girondin deputy Vergniaud, who, upon hearing the list of those to be arrested, mockingly offered the Convention a "drink of blood," perfectly encapsulate the Girondin perspective of the event as a descent into bloody tyranny and mob rule.25

  

## Chapter V. Conclusion: The Jacobin Model of Revolutionary Coordination

  

The revolutionary journées of 1792 and 1793 were not chaotic accidents of history. They were the product of a sophisticated and evolving model of political coordination developed and perfected by the Jacobins and their allies. This model, which fused ideological leadership, municipal authority, grassroots mobilization, and armed force into a single, cohesive revolutionary engine, represents a seminal moment in the history of modern politics. It demonstrated how a determined and well-organized minority could harness popular discontent to seize control of the state and liquidate its political opponents.

  

### The Interlocking Directorate: A Synthesis of Power

  

The foundational strength of the Jacobin model was its creation of an interlocking directorate of revolutionary power. Success did not stem from a single organization but from the ability to synchronize the actions of four distinct but interconnected spheres: the ideological leadership of the Jacobin Club, the administrative and command authority of the Paris Commune, the grassroots energy of the 48 Sections, and the coercive power of the co-opted National Guard and the sans-culottes. This integrated system allowed the Jacobins to translate abstract political goals, debated in the club, into decisive physical force on the streets. It was a structure that could both generate and direct popular anger with remarkable precision, giving the Jacobins a weapon that their less organized rivals, like the Girondins, could not counter.

  

### From Spontaneity to Strategy: The Evolution of the Journée

  

The analysis of the journées of August 1792 and June 1793 reveals a clear and rapid evolution in the nature of revolutionary action. Early events of the Revolution, like the storming of the Bastille, contained significant elements of spontaneity. By 1792, however, the journée had been transformed into a proactive, highly strategic, and centrally coordinated political weapon. The following table illustrates this evolution by comparing the two key insurrections:

  

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Metric|Journée of 10 August 1792|Journée of 31 May - 2 June 1793|
|Political Catalyst|Brunswick Manifesto, Royal Vetoes 15|Economic Crisis, Vendée Revolt, Girondin actions 47|
|Primary Target|The Monarchy (Louis XVI)|The Girondin Faction in the Convention|
|Key Planners/Instigators|Danton, Robespierre, Insurrectionary Commune 13|Robespierre, Marat, Évêché Committee 12|
|Mobilization Signals|Tocsin, Sectional Ultimatum 15|Tocsin, Alarm Cannon, Jacobin speeches 12|
|Primary Armed Force|Fédérés, National Guard, Sans-Culottes 15|National Guard, Sans-Culottes 11|
|Key Tactical Action|Assassination of Mandat, Storming of Tuileries 13|Military encirclement and intimidation of the Convention 12|
|Political Objective|Abolish Monarchy, Establish Republic 15|Purge rival faction, Seize control of Convention 12|
|Immediate Outcome|Suspension of King, Call for National Convention 15|Arrest of 29 Girondins, Montagnard dominance 12|

As the table demonstrates, the target of the insurrection shifted from an external enemy of the revolution (the King) to an internal one (a rival political faction). The planning became more centralized, moving from a broader insurrectionary Commune to a dedicated, hand-picked committee at the Évêché. The tactics became more precise, evolving from a bloody frontal assault on a palace to a coercive siege of the legislature itself. This evolution shows a clear learning curve. The "failed" attempt on 31 May 1793 was not a defeat but a crucial dress rehearsal that allowed the leadership to correct tactical errors in timing and force concentration, ensuring the overwhelming success of June 2.

Ultimately, the Jacobins did not merely ride the wave of popular anger; they learned to build the vessel, chart its course, and direct the storm. In doing so, they created a powerful and ruthless model of revolutionary action that would be studied, admired, and feared for centuries to come, leaving an indelible mark on the theory and practice of political change.54 Their coordination of the

journées stands as a stark testament to the power of organization, propaganda, and strategy in shaping the destiny of nations.
