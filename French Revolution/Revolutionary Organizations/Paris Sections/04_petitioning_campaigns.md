# The People's Voice, The People's Power: The Petitioning Campaigns of the Paris Sections and their Dominion over the National Convention, 1792-1794

  
  

## Introduction

  

The Paris Sections, established by decree in 1790 as mere administrative units, rapidly evolved into the primary engine of revolutionary radicalization during the French Revolution.1 This report posits that through a sophisticated and escalating repertoire of petitioning, backed by organized and armed force, the Sections were not merely supplicants to the national legislature but active, and often dominant, participants in governance. They consistently compelled a reluctant and frequently divided National Convention to enact its most defining and radical legislation, from the abolition of the monarchy to the institution of the Terror. This dynamic of popular pressure, however, ultimately proved unsustainable. The very power the Convention had relied upon to defeat its enemies became a threat to its own authority, forcing the deputies into the Thermidorian Reaction, a violent turn against their own popular power base that brought the most radical phase of the Revolution to a close.

This analysis will focus on the period from the Sections' creation in 1790 to their suppression in 1795, with particular emphasis on the zenith of their influence between 1792 and 1794. The methodology employed is a close reading of primary source evidence—including the texts of petitions, records of sectional and legislative assemblies, and contemporary accounts—to trace the causal chain from popular demand to legislative action. The report situates itself within the broader historiography of the Revolution, moving beyond traditional narratives of class struggle or amorphous mob rule. Instead, it incorporates modern analyses of political mobilization, such as the concept of a "repertoire of contention," to understand the Sections as sophisticated political actors who strategically deployed a range of tactics to achieve their aims.3

  

## Part I: The Crucible of Popular Sovereignty: Formation and Ideological Foundations of the Paris Sections

  

The political ascent of the Paris Sections was made possible by a unique confluence of administrative restructuring and revolutionary ideology. Initially conceived for mundane governance, their structure and the legal-philosophical framework of the new regime positioned them perfectly to become the authentic, organized voice of the sovereign people.

  

### A. From Districts to Sections: The Administrative and Political Genesis (1790)

  

The institutional framework for the Sections was laid by a decree of the National Constituent Assembly on May 21, 1790, sanctioned by King Louis XVI on June 27. This law replaced the 60 temporary districts, which had been created solely for the purpose of electing deputies to the 1789 Estates-General, with 48 permanent "sections".1 These new bodies were not just electoral units but were endowed with significant local authority as territorial and administrative divisions. They inherited the powers of the preceding districts, assuming responsibility for crucial functions like local policing, food supply, and a range of civil matters.5 This state-sanctioned mandate gave them a legitimate institutional structure and a formal role in the governance of the capital. Furthermore, the Sections were integrated into the overarching municipal government of the Paris Commune. Each section elected delegates to the Commune's General Council, establishing a formal, hierarchical link that allowed local concerns to be channeled directly to a higher level of political authority.5

  

### B. "The Nation Assembled": The Right to Petition in Revolutionary Law and Ideology

  

The Sections' power was built upon a legal and ideological foundation that transformed the act of petitioning from a plea to a political demand. The foundational document of the era, the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, located the source of all political authority in the populace, asserting in Article 3 that "The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation".8 This concept of popular sovereignty, heavily influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's notion of a unified General Will, reframed the people not as subjects requesting favors from a monarch, but as the ultimate sovereign expressing its collective will.10

This philosophical principle was given practical legal force by the Constitution of 1791. Title I explicitly guaranteed as a natural and civil right the "liberty to address individually signed petitions to the constituted authorities".11 This constitutional provision supplied the precise legal mechanism that the Sections would masterfully exploit. When the Sections presented a petition, they did so not as a collection of humble subjects, but as the voice of "the nation assembled," the physical embodiment of the sovereign people whose will the legislators were, in theory, bound to enact.9

  

### C. The Anatomy of a Section: Civil Committees, Revolutionary Committees, and Armed Force

  

Each of the 48 Sections was a miniature republic, possessing its own civil, judicial, and military apparatus. This tripartite structure gave the Sections the organizational capacity to deliberate, police their neighborhoods, and, crucially, enforce their political will.

The day-to-day administration of each Section was managed by an elected Civil Committee composed of 16 members. These committees handled local administrative tasks, oversaw local judges (juges de paix), and served as the official liaison with the Paris Commune.2

Established later by a law of March 21, 1793, the Revolutionary Committees became the local instruments of the Terror. Initially tasked with the surveillance of foreigners, their authority expanded dramatically with the passage of the Law of Suspects in September 1793. This law empowered them to compile lists of counter-revolutionaries, issue arrest warrants, and grant or deny certificates of citizenship (certificats de civisme), which were essential for daily life. They corresponded directly with the Committee of General Security, the national political police, effectively making them the neighborhood-level enforcement arm of the central government's security state.2

Most importantly, every Section commanded its own Armed Force. Paris's armed force was organized into six legions, with each legion composed of the troops from eight sections. Each section's contingent had its own command structure and comprised companies of 120 to 130 men. Critically, each section also possessed its own artillery company, complete with 60 men and two cannons.2 This meant that every petition delivered by a Sectional delegation was backed by a "popular militia".5 The demands were not mere words on paper; they were implicitly, and often explicitly, backed by the threat of organized, armed force, a fact that lent immense and intimidating weight to their "requests."

The revolutionary government, in a move of profound consequence, inadvertently created the very vehicle of its own radicalization. The Le Chapelier Law, passed on June 14, 1791, was designed to suppress popular organization by banning citizens of the same trade or profession from forming associations or presenting collective petitions.14 It explicitly forbade workers from appointing presidents or drafting regulations concerning their "alleged common interests." This law effectively crippled traditional, economic-based labor organization. However, the Sections, having been established by the state itself as

territorial and administrative bodies, were exempt from this prohibition. A petition from the "Carpenters of Paris" was illegal, but a petition from the geographically-defined Section des Quinze-Vingts—which was populated by those same carpenters—was perfectly legal. This crucial legal distinction channeled the immense energy of popular discontent away from the now-prohibited trade guilds and directly into the sanctioned framework of the sectional assemblies. In attempting to control one form of collective action, the state unintentionally nurtured a far more potent and politicized one, transforming the Sections into the primary engine of mass mobilization for the Parisian sans-culottes.

  

## Part II: The Voice of the People: Major Petitioning Campaigns and their Political Aims

  

The Sections deployed their organizational power in a series of escalating campaigns that targeted every perceived enemy of the Revolution. From the King to moderate deputies to economic "profiteers," the Sections used the petition, backed by the threat of insurrection, to systematically dismantle the old order and compel the creation of a radical republic.

  

### A. "The King Must Be Deposed": The Campaign Against the Monarchy (Summer 1792)

  

The final assault on the French monarchy was not a spontaneous uprising but a carefully orchestrated campaign led by the Paris Sections. The journée of June 20, 1792, served as a "dress rehearsal".4 On that day, thousands of armed

sans-culottes marched through the Legislative Assembly and into the Tuileries Palace, where they confronted Louis XVI and famously forced him to don the red bonnet rouge of liberty.15 This demonstration, while not overthrowing the King, tested the resolve of the authorities and proved the Sections' capacity for mass mobilization.

The catalyst for the final push came on August 1, 1792, with the arrival in Paris of the Brunswick Manifesto. This proclamation from the commander of the invading Austro-Prussian army threatened "unforgettable vengeance" on Paris if any harm came to the royal family, an external threat that galvanized the Sections into immediate action.16 Two days later, on August 3, the Mayor of Paris, Jérôme Pétion, appeared before the Legislative Assembly to present a formidable petition on behalf of the Commune and the Sections. The text was a powerful indictment, methodically listing Louis XVI's "misdeeds"—from his "bloody policies against the city of Paris" to his protection of counter-revolutionary priests. The petition skillfully framed the demand for removal not as a revolutionary whim but as a constitutional necessity, arguing that the King was in a "perpetual and formal act of disobedience to the constitution." It concluded with a stark challenge: "Louis XVI ceaselessly invokes the constitution; we invoke it in turn, and ask that he be deposed".17

When the Assembly hesitated, the Sections escalated from petition to ultimatum. A near-unanimous vote across the city saw 47 of the 48 sections demand the King's deposition.2 The radical Quinze-Vingts section delivered the final warning: if the Assembly did not depose the King by midnight on August 9, they would "sound the tocsin and attack the royal residence".16 The Assembly failed to act. True to their word, the Sections executed their plan. On the night of August 9, their commissioners took over the Hôtel de Ville, forming a new revolutionary Paris Commune. On August 10, the armed forces of the Sections, joined by

fédérés from Marseille and Brittany, stormed the Tuileries Palace, massacring the Swiss Guard and forcing the royal family to seek refuge with the very Assembly that had failed to act.16 The monarchy was finished.

  

### B. "War on Tyrants": The Purge of the Girondins (Spring 1793)

  

Following the abolition of the monarchy, a new power struggle emerged within the National Convention between the radical Montagnards, who were closely allied with the Paris Sections, and the more moderate Girondin faction.20 The conflict centered on the fate of the King, the conduct of the war, and, critically, economic policy. The Girondins' opposition to the immediate execution of the King and their resistance to price controls on grain earned them the enmity of the Parisian

sans-culottes, who, with the encouragement of the Montagnards, began to view them as enemies of the Republic.21

A coordinated campaign of pressure began in the spring of 1793, orchestrated by the Sections, the Commune, and radical political clubs. The Cordeliers Club, a key nexus of popular radicalism, collaborated with the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women to present a joint petition to the Jacobin Club on May 19, 1793. This petition was a declaration of war on the Girondin faction, demanding the immediate arrest of "suspect men" and explicitly naming Girondin leaders like Brissot and Vergniaud as the "general staff of the counterrevolutionary army".23

This campaign of words culminated in another armed journée on May 31. Led by the Commune and its National Guard commander, Hanriot, thousands of armed section members and their cannons surrounded the Convention's hall at the Tuileries Palace.24 The contemporary writer Louis-Sébastien Mercier described the scene of organized intimidation: "All of Paris was under arms... Municipal sashes were seen all through the faubourgs... inviting them to march in the name of the sovereign people".24 For three days, the legislators were held hostage. On June 2, the Convention finally capitulated, voting to expel and arrest 29 Girondin deputies. The purge was complete, and political power shifted decisively to the Montagnards, who now owed their supremacy directly to the coercive power of the Paris Sections.21

  

### C. "Bread and the Law": Economic Demands and the General Maximum

  

Underpinning much of the political radicalism of the sans-culottes was profound economic distress. The high price of bread was a constant source of unrest, and the Sections consistently demanded government intervention to control prices and punish those they deemed "speculators, the hoarders, and the egotistical merchants".7

This economic anger boiled over in the late summer of 1793, fueled by food riots and the shocking news that the key naval port of Toulon had been surrendered to the British.5 On September 5, a massive delegation from the Sections and the Commune marched on the Convention. Their petition was blunt: "Food, and to get it, strength for the law". They demanded the immediate creation of an internal "revolutionary army," which would march through the countryside to enforce the law, requisition grain, and "make avarice and cupidity cough up the wealth of the land".25

The Convention, facing an angry and armed populace, immediately yielded. In direct response to the petition, it formally decreed that "Terror is the Order of the Day".13 This was the moment terror was institutionalized as official government policy, a direct concession to popular pressure. The Convention also decreed the formation of the Parisian revolutionary army and, on September 29, passed the Law of the General Maximum, which imposed sweeping price and wage controls across the economy.20 The economic program of the Sections had become the law of the land.

  

### D. "Temples of Reason": The Sections and the De-Christianization Movement

  

The radicalism of the Sections extended from politics and economics into the cultural and religious sphere. The autumn of 1793 saw a wave of de-Christianization sweep across France, and the Paris Sections were at its epicenter.26 Prominent figures from the Commune, such as its procurator Pierre Gaspard Chaumette, were leading ideologues of the movement, publicly denouncing Christianity and its priests as agents of "ignorance and superstition".28

Sectional assemblies and their allied popular societies actively petitioned for and participated in the campaign. They drove the closure of churches, the destruction of religious statues and icons, and the forced resignation of clergy.26 The Archbishop of Paris, Gobel, was compelled to publicly resign his duties and don the red cap of liberty.26 The movement's most famous spectacle was the Festival of Reason, held on November 10, 1793, in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, which was renamed a "Temple of Reason" for the occasion.26 While the Convention, particularly Robespierre, would later grow wary of this atheistic movement, its initial surge was undeniably driven from the ground up by the radical energy of the Paris Sections and the Commune.26

  

## Part III: The Repertoire of Contention: Organizational Methods of Mass Mobilization

  

The Sections' remarkable success was not accidental; it was the result of sophisticated organizational methods that allowed them to deliberate internally, coordinate city-wide action, and stage powerful public demonstrations. They mastered a "repertoire of contention" that blended quasi-parliamentary procedure with revolutionary spectacle.

  

### A. The Sectional Assembly in Practice: Procedures, Debates, and Drafting Petitions

  

Beginning in July 1792, the 48 Sections declared themselves to be in "permanent session." This critical step allowed them to maintain constant political vigilance, react swiftly to events, and serve as ongoing forums for radical debate and mobilization.2 The proceedings were not the chaotic gatherings of a mob but often followed structured, quasi-parliamentary rules. Surviving records from the Quinze-Vingts section in August 1792 reveal a formal process: the assembly received delegations from other sections, held debates, passed decrees based on "unanimous agreement," and formally appointed commissioners to carry out specific tasks, such as liaising with the other 47 sections.18 To manage debate in such large assemblies, some sections even adapted the "bureau" system used by the National Assembly, where members would break into smaller groups to discuss motions before a general vote.31 Recognizing that many working-class

sans-culottes could not afford to miss work to attend meetings, the Convention, under pressure from the Sections, decreed that a stipend be paid to citizens who attended the twice-weekly assemblies, ensuring broad participation.25

  

### B. Networks of Radicalism: Coordination between Sections, the Commune, and Political Clubs

  

The power of the Sections lay in their ability to act in concert, presenting a unified front to the national government. Their primary coordinating mechanism was the delegation of commissioners to a central body. This was most effectively demonstrated on August 9, 1792, when commissioners from the sections converged on the Hôtel de Ville to dissolve the existing municipal government and constitute themselves as the new revolutionary Commune, which then directed the insurrection against the King.2

The political clubs of Paris served as crucial, informal coordinating hubs. While the Jacobin Club was influential, the more populist and radical Cordeliers Club was the true heart of sectional activism.32 Led by figures like Danton and Marat, the Cordeliers championed democratic agitation and came to dominate the sectional movement.33 They provided a space where leaders from different sections could meet, strategize, and draft joint petitions. This network was inclusive, with the Cordeliers collaborating directly with groups like the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women to amplify their demands, as evidenced by their joint petition against the Girondins in May 1793.23 This interconnected system of sections, clubs, and the Commune created a powerful political echo chamber, allowing a radical demand to be formulated in a neighborhood assembly, amplified by city-wide clubs, legitimized by the Commune, and finally presented to the Convention as the incontrovertible "will of the people of Paris."

  

### C. The Street as a Political Stage: The Visual and Ceremonial Culture of the Journée

  

The Sections perfected the art of the journée, or day-long demonstration, transforming the streets of Paris into a political stage for revolutionary theater. These events were typically not spontaneous riots but highly organized marches along symbolically charged routes, often proceeding from the revolutionary heartland of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine and the Place de la Bastille to the seat of power at the Tuileries Palace.4

The visual power of these demonstrations was immense. The sans-culottes adopted a distinctive uniform that served as a visual badge of their political identity and social class. They rejected the silk knee-breeches (culottes) of the aristocracy in favor of the working man's long trousers (pantalons), from which they derived their name. This was paired with a short jacket (carmagnole) and the iconic bonnet rouge, or Phrygian cap, an ancient Roman symbol of freed slaves.15 These symbols, along with the tricolore cockade pinned to their hats, created an instantly recognizable and intimidating presence.37

The demonstrations were rich with ceremony and symbolism. Protesters marched in disciplined columns behind banners emblazoned with revolutionary slogans. They sang patriotic anthems like "La Marseillaise" to create an auditory spectacle of unity and fervor. They carried pikes—the people's weapon—often topped with a liberty cap, and they engaged in symbolic acts like planting "liberty trees" to mark their reclamation of public space.4 This combination of visual, auditory, and ceremonial elements created an emotionally charged and powerful display of popular solidarity.

The tactical repertoire of the Sections was not static but evolved through experience. A clear pattern emerges where dialogue was the first resort, followed by coercion when dialogue failed. Early demonstrations, such as the march of June 20, 1792, were armed but emphasized order and non-violence, aiming to present a "powerful, essentially unified, and scrupulously nonviolent front".4 The stated goal was to engage in a "fraternal dialogue with Revolutionary elites" and persuade them to accept popular demands.3 However, when this dialogue was met with resistance—the King's continued vetoes, the Girondins' intransigence—the tactics escalated. The petition became an ultimatum. The armed march became an armed encirclement of the legislature. The cannons brought by the sectional artillery units were not merely for show. This progression reveals a pragmatic, strategic learning process. The Sections discovered that while the

language of popular sovereignty was potent, it was the physical demonstration of that sovereignty through the credible threat of overwhelming force that ultimately compelled the state to act.

  

## Part IV: The Echo in the Assembly: Measuring the Influence on the National Convention

  

The influence of the Sections was not abstract; it can be measured directly by tracing the path from popular demand to legislative decree. The petitioning campaigns, backed by the power of the journées, systematically forced the National Convention to adopt its most radical and defining policies.

  

### A. From Petition to Decree: Tracing the Legislative Impact

  

The most consequential laws of the revolutionary period were frequently not conceived by deputies deliberating in isolation but were passed under the immediate and explicit pressure of the Parisian populace. The causal link between the demands articulated in the Sections' petitions and the subsequent actions of the Convention is direct and demonstrable.

  

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Campaign / Journée|Date(s)|Key Demands of the Sections (with Source)|Primary Actors / Sections|Resulting Convention Decree(s) / Action(s) (with Source)|
|Dethronement of the King|Aug 3-10, 1792|"We invoke [the constitution] in turn, and ask that he be deposed." 17|Quinze-Vingts, Faubourg Saint-Antoine, Mayor Pétion, Revolutionary Commune|Provisional suspension of the King (Aug 10); Call for a National Convention (Aug 10); Abolition of the monarchy (Sep 21) 16|
|Purge of the Girondins|May 19 - June 2, 1793|Demand for the arrest of "suspect men" and Girondin leaders, described as the "general staff of the counterrevolutionary army." 23|Cordeliers Club, Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, Commune, Hanriot|Arrest of 29 Girondin deputies and two ministers (June 2) 20|
|The General Maximum & The Terror|Sep 5, 1793|"Let this [revolutionary] army form its core in Paris immediately... Let an incorruptible and formidable tribunal follow this army..." 25|Sections led by the Commune, Hébert, Chaumette|Decree that "Terror is the Order of the Day" (Sep 5); Creation of a Parisian revolutionary army (Sep 9); Law of the General Maximum (Sep 29); Law of Suspects (Sep 17) 13|
|De-Christianization|Fall 1793|(Driven by actions and speeches) Closure of churches, forced resignation of clergy, establishment of the Cult of Reason 26|Paris Commune (Chaumette, Hébert), various Sections|Convention endorses Festival of Reason; passes law for revolutionary calendar abolishing Sundays (Oct 1793) 26|

  

### B. Fracturing the Republic: How Sectional Pressure Polarized the Convention

  

The relentless pressure exerted by the Sections was a primary cause of the bitter factionalism that defined and ultimately paralyzed the National Convention. The Girondins, though committed revolutionaries, were wary of the "public's passions" and resented the disproportionate influence that the capital wielded over national politics.21 Their principled opposition to the Sections' radical economic and political demands was skillfully reframed by their opponents as evidence of counter-revolutionary sentiment.

In stark contrast, the Montagnard faction built its power base by championing the cause of the sans-culottes and the Sections.20 Leaders like Robespierre initially rose to prominence as fierce advocates for popular rights, including the right to petition.41 This alliance, however, came at the cost of legislative independence. The petitions themselves became flashpoints of conflict. The Girondin president of the Convention, Maximin Isnard, famously responded to the "insolent imprecations" and "seditious" petitions by threatening that if the national representation were violated, "Paris would be annihilated." This threat, intended to defend the Convention's authority, only served to inflame the sectional activists and seal the fate of his faction.24

  

### C. The Inevitable Backlash: The Convention's Suppression of Popular Power

  

The relationship between the Montagnards and the Sections was initially symbiotic. The Montagnards required the Sections' physical power to vanquish their political rivals, the Girondins; the Sections required the Montagnards' legislative authority to enact their social and economic agenda. Once their common enemy was eliminated, however, this symbiosis turned parasitic. The Committee of Public Safety, now the de facto government, found itself subjected to the same popular pressures it had previously encouraged. Even more radical factions, like the Hébertists, used the Sections and the Cordeliers Club to agitate for a further intensification of the Terror and a more radical redistribution of wealth, directly challenging the Committee's authority.20

To maintain control, the Committee was forced to turn on its own power base. In the spring of 1794, it moved to eliminate all rival centers of power, orchestrating the arrest and execution of the radical Hébertist leaders and, shortly thereafter, the more moderate Dantonist faction. This purge was a decisive move to reassert the state's monopoly on power, but it came at a fatal cost. By executing the "voice of the sans-culottes" and intimidating their followers into submission, the Committee of Public Safety destroyed the very popular movement that had brought it to power.20 This act of political self-cannibalism left the Robespierrist government isolated and vulnerable. As one analysis notes, "By executing the Hébertists and alienating the sans-culottes, the Committee became unnecessary to the Assembly".20 The Thermidorian Reaction of July 1794, which saw the overthrow and execution of Robespierre, was the Convention's final, violent rejection of this system of popular intimidation. The deputies, having seen the power of the Sections devour faction after faction, moved to dismantle the machinery of radicalism. The Jacobin Club was closed, and in 1795, the new Directory government formally suppressed the Sections themselves, ending their extraordinary role in French politics.2

  

## Conclusion: The Legacy of the Sections in the History of Mass Mobilization

  

The petitioning campaigns of the Paris Sections represent a pivotal moment in the history of popular politics. Their legacy is complex, embodying a fundamental duality that continues to resonate in the study of mass mobilization and democratic theory.

  

### A "Dress Rehearsal for Violence" or an "Innovation in Peaceful Protest"? A Historiographical Assessment

  

Historians have long debated the nature of the revolutionary journées. Traditional accounts often portray them as precursors to violence, dress rehearsals for bloody insurrection.4 There is undeniable truth to this view; the storming of the Tuileries and the coercive purge of the Girondins were acts of armed force. However, to focus solely on the violence is to overlook the profound innovation in political action that the Sections pioneered. A significant portion of their demonstrations remained physically non-violent, representing a new form of political dialogue between the people and their elected representatives.3 They developed a sophisticated repertoire of protest that included organized marches, symbolic ceremonies, and the presentation of formal petitions, all aimed at building a "fraternal dialogue" with governing elites.3 The legacy of the Sections, therefore, is this inherent duality: they created many of the foundational tactics of modern, peaceful mass political demonstration, yet the ultimate effectiveness of these tactics was always underpinned by the credible threat of organized violence.

  

### The Parisian Sections as a Model for Direct Democracy and its Perils

  

The history of the Paris Sections from 1792 to 1794 stands as one of the most potent examples of direct democracy in action on a mass scale. They proved that an organized, armed, and politically conscious populace could assert its sovereignty and directly shape national policy, forcing a legislature to bend to its will. They were the embodiment of the revolutionary principle that the "will of the people" was the highest law.10

Yet, their story is also a profound cautionary tale. The system of governance by petition and intimidation proved inherently unstable. The constant pressure for ideological purity and ever-greater radicalism created a volatile political environment that ultimately turned on and consumed itself. The rise and fall of the Sections illuminate the deep and enduring tension between the abstract ideal of popular sovereignty and the practical necessity of stable, institutional governance—a central dilemma that has confronted modern democracies since their revolutionary birth.
