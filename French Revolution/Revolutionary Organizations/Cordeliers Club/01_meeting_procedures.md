# "The Eye of the People": Procedure, Debate, and Decision in the Club des Cordeliers, 1790-1794

  
  

## Introduction

  

The Club des Cordeliers, more than any other political society of the French Revolution, embodied a radical and often chaotic experiment in direct democracy. Lacking formal, codified procedures, its internal operations—from debate formats to decision-making—were a dynamic and volatile fusion of populist ideology, performative politics, and spontaneous popular will. This report will reconstruct these unwritten rules by forensically analyzing a mosaic of fragmented primary sources, arguing that the club's procedural character was not a flaw but a direct expression of its core mission: to serve as the unmediated "eye of the people," a role that made it a powerful engine of revolution and, ultimately, a target for elimination by the centralized revolutionary state.

A significant methodological challenge underpins any study of the Cordeliers: the apparent absence of official, comprehensive meeting minutes, or procès-verbaux.1 Unlike the Jacobins, whose proceedings were more systematically recorded, the Cordeliers' internal life must be pieced together from disparate sources. Searches for a formal

règlement intérieur (internal rulebook) have proven fruitless, yielding only documents for modern institutions bearing the same name.3 This confirms that the club's procedures were likely emergent and unwritten rather than formally codified. This report, therefore, adopts a methodology of reconstruction, drawing upon police reports, petitions, journalistic accounts, and contemporary descriptions to build a coherent, if incomplete, picture of the club's inner life.

  

## The Crucible of Radicalism: Foundation, Ideology, and Composition

  

The unique procedures of the Cordeliers Club did not emerge from a vacuum. They were the direct product of the club's origins, its radical ideology, and its distinct social composition, all of which combined to create a political body fundamentally different from its contemporaries.

  

### From District to Club: The Inheritance of Vigilance

  

The Cordeliers Club was the direct successor to the Cordeliers District, one of the sixty electoral districts of Paris created in 1789. This district was already renowned for its political radicalism and activism.6 Led by figures such as Georges Danton, the district had played a significant role in the Storming of the Bastille and distinguished itself by its fierce opposition to the centralizing authority of the Paris Commune.6 When the National Assembly decreed the dissolution of the sixty districts in May-June 1790, the leaders of the Cordeliers district founded the

Société des Amis des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen in April 1790 to perpetuate their mission.6 The club explicitly viewed itself as the continuation of the district's work, inheriting its legacy of popular mobilization and suspicion of constituted authority.13

A foundational text illustrating this inherited ideology is the record of the dispute between the Cordeliers district and the Paris Commune in November 1789. The district asserted its right to revoke its own deputies and to compel them to swear a specific oath of loyalty to the district's will.14 This early conflict demonstrates a pre-existing commitment to the principles of the imperative mandate and direct popular sovereignty, which would become hallmarks of the club's decision-making processes.

  

### The Ideological Framework: Surveillance, Rights, and Republicanism

  

The club's formal name, the Society of the Friends of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and its popularization of the motto Liberté, égalité, fraternité, underscore its foundational commitment to the 1789 Declaration of Rights.6 Its primary self-defined function was to act as a watchdog, to "prevent the abuse of power" and "infractions of the rights of man".11 This mission was powerfully symbolized by its official emblem: an open eye, representing constant popular surveillance over the government.2

The club's ideology was unusually democratic for its time, drawing not only on the theories of Jean-Jacques Rousseau but also, uniquely among Parisian clubs, on the works of English republican thinkers like James Harrington.7 This intellectual influence was particularly evident in their proposals for the popular ratification of laws via referenda, a key idea that distinguished their brand of republicanism from that of the Jacobins and directly informed their political proposals.16

  

### The Social Fabric: A Populist Mandate with Bourgeois Leadership

  

The social composition of the Cordeliers Club was marked by a defining paradox. On the one hand, the club prided itself on its populist accessibility. Membership fees were deliberately kept low, or were entirely donation-based, in stark contrast to the prohibitively expensive Jacobin Club.6 This open-door policy was designed to welcome a broad spectrum of society, including women and "passive citizens"—those who lacked the property qualifications required to vote.8

On the other hand, the club's leadership was dominated by members of the educated middle class and liberal professions. Its most prominent figures were lawyers like Georges Danton, journalists such as Camille Desmoulins, Jean-Paul Marat, and Jacques-René Hébert, and playwrights like Fabre d'Églantine.8 This created a dynamic where a bourgeois leadership derived its power from its ability to mobilize and speak for the Parisian

sans-culottes.23

A vivid contemporary account captures this social mixture, describing a meeting of "about three hundred persons of both sexes" whose "dress was so unkempt and so filthy that one would have taken them for a gathering of beggars".6 This description should not be seen as a simple contradiction of its bourgeois leadership. Rather, the "unkempt" aesthetic of the club's rank-and-file was a crucial element of its political identity. It was a form of performative populism, a visual representation of the club's claim to be the authentic, unvarnished voice of the common people. This stood in sharp contrast to the perceived elitism of the Jacobins and the formal decorum of the National Assembly. This cultivated image of rawness was a strategic tool that asserted the club's legitimacy and became the very source of its insurrectionary influence. While precise membership statistics over time are unavailable, a fact noted by historians and indicative of the club's informal nature, its political weight was undeniable.2

  

## The Mechanics of a People's Society: Reconstructing Meeting Procedures

  

The internal procedures of the Cordeliers Club were designed to maximize popular participation and emotional expression, often at the expense of formal order. The meetings were not merely deliberative sessions but revolutionary performances, staged in a space designed to inspire and agitate.

  

### The Setting: A Revolutionary Theater

  

Meetings were initially held in the nationalized monastery of the Cordeliers and later, after their expulsion in 1791, in a hall on the Rue Dauphine.2 The decor of the meeting hall was highly symbolic, consciously framing the debates within a revolutionary tradition. The Declaration of the Rights of Man was prominently displayed on a wall, "crowned by crossed daggers." Plaster busts of republican heroes like Brutus and William Tell stood as symbolic "guards," while the intellectual patronage of Enlightenment thinkers was acknowledged with busts of Rousseau and Helvétius.6 This was not a neutral space for debate but a theater for revolutionary politics, where every element of the environment reinforced the club's radical mission.

  

### Order and Tumult: The Flow of a Session

  

While no formal rulebook has survived, primary source accounts allow for a reconstruction of a typical meeting's flow. A president appears to have guided the sessions, though their control was often tenuous.25 A police report from March 1794 provides a rare, detailed snapshot of the club's procedures in action.26 The session opened with a motion from a member to expel those who missed meetings, which was then "vigorously opposed and defeated," indicating a process of open debate followed by a collective decision. The reading of correspondence was a standard order of business. However, the club's procedural flexibility was on full display when, with no letters to read, a member spontaneously mounted the rostrum to read a report by Saint-Just that he happened to have in his pocket, occupying the society for a full hour.26

The active role of the audience was another defining feature. An account of a joint deputation with the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women in May 1793 describes an orator presenting a petition from a rostrum while the audience interjects with "Noise" and expresses its approval with applause.27 The speaker is forced to actively manage the crowd, crying out, "I demand...the fullest attention," to restore calm. This dynamic interaction between the speaker and the assembly was central to the club's proceedings.

  

### Debate Formats: Oratory, Denunciation, and Acclamation

  

The Cordeliers did not employ the formal, timed debate structures common in modern deliberative bodies.29 The format was fluid and centered on persuasive oratory. Major proposals were delivered as prepared speeches, but the floor was also open to spontaneous and passionate debate, as shown by the "vigorous" opposition to the motion on attendance.26

A key function of the meetings, and a central component of their debates, was the identification and denunciation of "conspiracies" and "enemies of the Republic".26 This was not merely rhetoric but a core political activity. The police report from March 1794, for example, notes the focus on the recently arrested Hébert and his associates, demonstrating the club's preoccupation with purging perceived traitors from the body politic.26

The procedural style of the Cordeliers was a direct enactment of their ideology. The mixture of formal elements, like a president and a rostrum, with chaotic interruptions, audience participation, and spontaneous speeches was not a failure of order. It was a system designed to be porous, where the unmediated "will of the people," expressed through noise and acclamation, could directly influence and even override formal proceedings. This procedural openness was a living embodiment of the direct democracy the club championed. It was also, however, fundamentally incompatible with the Jacobins' increasingly centralized and controlled vision of revolutionary governance, which viewed such popular interventions as a dangerous form of anarchy that usurped the legitimate authority of the state.30

  

## From Deliberation to Action: The Decision-Making Process

  

The Cordeliers Club was not a mere debating society; it was, as the historian Albert Mathiez termed it, a "group of action and combat".8 Its decision-making processes were geared toward translating the will expressed in its tumultuous meetings into tangible political pressure and direct action.

  

### The Petition as a Revolutionary Weapon

  

The petition was the club's primary instrument for decision-making and political intervention. These were not humble requests but forceful demands, public manifestos, and ideological declarations.

A prime example is the petition drafted following the king's flight to Varennes in June-July 1791.31 The club's decision was radical: to declare that Louis XVI had "abdicated the throne" and that France must become a republic, or at the very least, hold a national referendum on the future of the monarchy. The petition's text justifies this decision by arguing that the "so-called convention between a people and its king no longer exists." Crucially, the club also decided on an action plan: the petition "shall be printed, posted, and then sent to all the departments and patriotic societies of the French empire".31 This was a decision to bypass the National Assembly and appeal directly to the nation, a profoundly revolutionary act of popular sovereignty.

A second case study, the joint petition with the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women in May 1793, shows the escalation of their demands.27 Here, the decision was to demand the immediate arrest of the Girondin deputies, the creation of revolutionary tribunals, the formation of a "Revolutionary army" of

sans-culottes paid for by a tax on the rich, and the "extermination" of speculators and hoarders. The decision-making process culminated in a justification of revolutionary violence, with the petition concluding that "insurrection is the ultimate reason of the people".27

  

### The Imperative Mandate and Strategic Alliances

  

The Cordeliers' belief in direct democracy extended to the role of elected officials. They championed the principle of the imperative mandate, wherein representatives were not free agents but delegates bound by the will of their constituents and subject to recall.8 This principle, first articulated in the 1789 conflict with the Commune, was a core tenet of their decision-making framework.14

The club also made strategic decisions to amplify its influence through alliances. The choice to form a joint deputation with the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women in 1793 was a calculated move to present a united front of radical men and women, thereby increasing pressure on the Jacobins and demonstrating a broader base of popular support for their extreme measures.27

  

## The Voice of the Cordeliers: Communication, Propaganda, and Quantitative Reach

  

The club's external communication strategy was essential for translating its decisions into popular action. Through a network of allied newspapers, posters, and petitions, the Cordeliers broadcast their radical message to Paris and beyond.

  

### The Associated Press: Factionalism in Print

  

The club's internal factions used newspapers as their primary weapons in the battle for public opinion. The moderate Dantonist faction, or "Indulgents," was associated with Camille Desmoulins's journal Le Vieux Cordelier ("The Old Cordelier"), while the radical Hébertist faction, or "Exaggerateds," was championed by Jacques-René Hébert's notoriously profane and popular paper, Le Père Duchesne.6 Jean-Paul Marat's influential

L'Ami du Peuple ("The Friend of the People") was also a key voice of Cordelier radicalism, deeply embedded in the district's political life.19 Desmoulins's decision to launch

Le Vieux Cordelier in late 1793 was a direct intervention in the club's internal politics, an attempt to reclaim the "Cordelier" name from the Hébertists and argue for an end to the Terror by appealing to the club's original principles of defending individual rights.16

  

### Circulation and Influence: A Quantitative Analysis

  

While precise circulation figures for many revolutionary papers are difficult to ascertain, available data suggests a massive and influential radical press. However, raw circulation numbers significantly understate the true reach of these publications. The daily circulation of L'Ami du Peuple, for instance, was estimated at only around 2,000 copies.36 This figure is misleading. In an era of limited literacy and high costs, newspapers were commonly read aloud in clubs, cafes, and public squares. Contemporaries estimated that each individual paper was read by an average of ten adults.37 Furthermore, radical papers like Marat's relied on a veritable army of street hawkers (

colporteurs) who would shout the sensational headlines and sell copies directly to the sans-culottes, reaching a wide oral culture.39 The effective daily audience of a paper like

L'Ami du Peuple was therefore likely closer to 20,000 people.

The following table synthesizes available data to provide a comparative estimate of the reach of key radical newspapers.

  

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Newspaper|Associated Faction/Figure|Estimated Daily Circulation|Source(s)|Estimated Effective Reach (Circulation x10)|Notes|
|L'Ami du Peuple|Marat / Cordeliers|~2,000|36|~20,000|Its influence far exceeded its print run due to public readings and a dedicated distribution network.|
|Le Père Duchesne|Hébert / Hébertists|"Best-selling" (post-Marat)|33|N/A (likely very high)|Precise figures are unavailable 42, but its populist style made it immensely popular with the|sans-culottes.|
|Le Vieux Cordelier|Desmoulins / Dantonists|Reached 100,000 (peak)|43|>1,000,000 (at peak)|A short-lived but massively influential polemic, demonstrating the huge market for political debate.|
|Total Parisian Daily|(All newspapers)|~130,000 (1791)|37|~1,300,000|Provides context for the scale of print media; radical papers were a significant portion of this market.|

  

### The Power of the Poster and the Petition

  

The club's decision to "print and post" its petitions was a key communication strategy.31 This act transformed a formal address to the legislature into a public manifesto, plastered on walls throughout Paris for all to see. It was a method of direct mass communication that served to radicalize public opinion and mobilize support for demonstrations, such as the fateful gathering at the Champ de Mars in July 1791.44

  

## Comparative Analysis: The Cordeliers and the Jacobins

  

The unique character of the Cordeliers' procedures and decision-making is best understood through a direct comparison with their chief rivals, the Jacobin Club.

  

### Organizational Models: Populism vs. Elitism

  

The fundamental differences in the two clubs' organizational structures shaped their political character and actions. The Cordeliers were defined by their populist accessibility, while the Jacobins cultivated a more structured and elite network.

  

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|Club des Cordeliers|Club des Jacobins|
|Official Name|Société des Amis des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen 11|Société des Amis de la Constitution 15|
|Membership Fees|Low or donation-based 6|High, exclusive 45|
|Membership Base|Open to "passive citizens" & women; populist 19|Primarily well-off bourgeoisie, professionals; women excluded from membership 45|
|Primary Goal|Surveillance of government, direct action, popular initiative 6|Influence policy within the Assembly, build national network of affiliates 30|
|Key Procedure|Petitions, direct deputations, popular mobilization 27|Debates on Assembly issues, correspondence with affiliates, purging of members 45|

  

### Divergent Paths on Sovereignty: Direct vs. Representative Democracy

  

The conflict between the Cordeliers and the Jacobins in 1793–94 was not merely a power struggle between individuals like Hébert and Robespierre; it was a fundamental clash between two irreconcilable models of revolutionary government.

The Cordelier model was one of direct popular sovereignty. Their procedures and decisions consistently reflected this ideology. They championed the right to insurrection as the people's ultimate recourse 27, advocated for the recall of deputies who betrayed the popular will 14, and proposed the use of referenda for the popular ratification of laws.6 Their meetings were designed to be a direct expression of this immediate popular will.

The Jacobin model, by contrast, evolved toward a theory of centralized, representative sovereignty embodied in the National Convention.25 While radical, they were more cautious; they supported the monarchy until the last possible moment and their July 1791 petition on the king's status was far less committal than the Cordeliers' outright demand for a republic.31 For the Jacobins in power, popular sovereignty was to be exercised

through the elected representatives in the Convention, not over them. The victory of the Jacobins and the subsequent execution of the Cordelier leadership in the spring of 1794 represented the triumph of the centralized, representative state over the localized, direct-democracy model.

  

## Conclusion

  

The meeting procedures, debate formats, and decision-making processes of the Club des Cordeliers were not accidental or disorganized. They were the logical, practical expression of a coherent and radical democratic ideology. The club's open-door policy, its tolerance for procedural tumult, its reliance on direct-action petitions, and its championing of the imperative mandate were all integral parts of a unique political project. The Cordeliers Club was a true "school of democracy" for the Parisian sans-culottes 30, but it was also a "group of action and combat".8 Its procedures, designed for popular mobilization and vigilance, proved ill-suited to the task of governing and were ultimately incompatible with the Jacobins' drive to consolidate state power during the Reign of Terror.

The suppression of the Cordeliers in March and April of 1794 was more than the elimination of a political faction; it was the definitive closure of the most potent avenue for direct popular sovereignty in the French Revolution. The "eye of the people" was forced shut, and with it, a unique and radical vision of what a republic could be. The club's history serves as a crucial case study in the inherent tensions between participatory democracy and the exigencies of the modern, centralized state—a tension that remains at the heart of political theory today.
