# The Altar and the Mountain: Popular Response to Religious Transformation in Revolutionary France, 1793-1794

  
  ![[../../../audio/Revolutionary Faith_ When France Tried to Erase God and Invent New Religions.mp3]]

## Introduction

  

The period of the French Revolution between 1793 and 1794 represents one of modern history's most audacious and violent attempts at state-led social and spiritual engineering. In what can be described as a cultural revolution, successive revolutionary governments sought not only to overthrow a monarchy but to remake the very soul of the French citizen. This ambition found its most radical expression in the Dechristianization Campaign and the subsequent creation of new civic religions: the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme Being. The core tension animating this tumultuous chapter of history, a tension that continues to fuel scholarly debate, is whether these transformative religious policies were a top-down imposition by a radical Parisian elite or a movement that resonated with, and was shaped by, genuine popular sentiments.1

The historiography of this period is dominated by the foundational work of scholars such as Mona Ozouf and Michel Vovelle. Ozouf's analysis of revolutionary festivals as a "transfer of sacrality" provides a critical lens for understanding the new cults' symbolic language and pedagogical aims, while Vovelle's quantitative studies of religious attitudes reveal the deep-seated regional and social complexities of faith and its decline.3 Their work establishes a framework for moving beyond a simple narrative of persecution to a more nuanced analysis of reception. This report builds upon that foundation, arguing that the popular response to the Revolution's religious agenda was not a monolithic rejection or acceptance. Rather, it was a complex and fragmented tapestry woven from threads of violent resistance, pragmatic compliance, localized enthusiasm, and widespread passive opposition. The reaction was profoundly fractured by geography, social class, and the dizzying pace of political change emanating from Paris.

To understand this complex response, this report will first analyze the systematic deconstruction of the Gallican Catholic Church, examining the legislative, symbolic, and physical assaults that provoked reactions ranging from quiet defiance to open civil war. It will then dissect the two major attempts to fill the spiritual void: the atheistic Cult of Reason and Robespierre's deistic Cult of the Supreme Being. By examining procedural details, participant testimonies from officials and common citizens, attendance figures for the new festivals, and contemporary assessments of their effectiveness, this analysis will demonstrate that while the revolutionary project was conceived in the political clubs and legislative halls of Paris, its fate was ultimately determined in the myriad towns, villages, and parishes of a nation grappling with the total upheaval of its world.

  

## Part I: The Deconstruction of the Gallican Church (1789-1794)

  

The assault on the Catholic Church was not a single event but a cascading series of legislative acts and popular actions that began with the Revolution itself. These policies progressively stripped the Church of its wealth, its independence, and its symbolic presence in French life, creating deep divisions within the nation and provoking a spectrum of popular responses.

  

### The Legislative Onslaught and the Seizure of Assets

  

The initial revolutionary policies targeted the Church's immense economic and political power, actions with which many, including some parish priests, could identify.1 The process began on the night of August 4, 1789, with the abolition of the tithe, the Church's primary source of income.1 This was swiftly followed by a more profound measure: on November 2, 1789, the National Assembly decreed that all Church property was to be "placed at the disposal of the nation".1 This massive confiscation, which included vast landholdings, was intended to stabilize the nation's finances through the sale of these assets at public auction to back the new

assignat currency.1

The decisive break, however, came with the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, passed on July 12, 1790.7 This law unilaterally restructured the French Church, transforming priests and bishops into salaried state employees to be elected by the people of their parish or bishopric.1 It severed the Gallican Church's traditional lines of authority to Rome and subordinated it entirely to the French state. The requirement for all clergy to swear an oath of loyalty to this new constitution created a profound and lasting schism. Pope Pius VI spent nearly eight months deliberating before issuing a formal condemnation on April 13, 1791, which solidified the division.1 The clergy fractured into "jurors" (those who took the oath) and "non-jurors" or "refractory priests" (those who refused).5

This legislative act, while intended to create a rationalized and compliant national church, had the unforeseen consequence of hyper-politicizing faith at the most local level. It was no longer a matter of distant ecclesiastical governance; it was a choice forced upon every priest and every community. The decision to swear the oath or refuse it became a public declaration of political allegiance. In many parts of France, particularly in rural and more devout regions, the constitutional "juror" priests were viewed with deep suspicion, while the refractory priests who remained became focal points for popular resentment and counter-revolutionary activity.5 A villager's choice of which Mass to attend was now a political statement, turning church pews into front lines in the battle for the nation's soul. This dynamic was a direct catalyst for the civil unrest that would later engulf regions like the Vendée.

  

### The War on Symbols and Time

  

The legislative attack was accompanied by a physical and cultural campaign to erase Christianity from public life. This "dechristianization" reached its zenith in 1793-1794 and was characterized by its visual and temporal totality. Decrees were passed ordering the destruction of crosses, bells, religious statues, and any other external signs of worship.2 By Easter 1794, few of France's approximately 40,000 churches remained open for traditional Catholic services.1 Many were closed, sold, or repurposed for secular use, becoming stables, artillery depots, store-houses, or Masonic halls.2 The most famous of these transformations was the conversion of churches into "Temples of Reason," most notably Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, where the inscription "To Philosophy" was carved in stone over the doors.10

Perhaps the most profound element of this cultural war was the abolition of the Gregorian calendar. On October 5, 1793, the National Convention adopted the French Republican Calendar, which retroactively began on September 22, 1792, the date of the proclamation of the Republic.12 This was a direct assault on the rhythm of Christian life. It replaced the seven-day week with a ten-day

décade, and its new month names were based on nature and agriculture (e.g., Vendémiaire for the grape harvest, Thermidor for heat).13 All references to the Church—the Sabbath, saints' days, Easter, Christmas—were eliminated.1

This attempt to re-engineer time itself provoked one of the most widespread and stubborn forms of popular resistance. While the state could change the official date, it struggled to change the ingrained habits of a lifetime. Municipal reports and personal diaries reveal a population that actively and passively defied the new system.16 People continued to don their "Sunday clothes" and promenade on the

ci-devant dimanche (the former Sunday). In the Vendée, fairs continued to be held "at the old time," and in Montréjeau, a crowd of 4,000 people showed up for an illegal market held on a traditional feast day, overwhelming the local gendarmes.16 Many refused to work on the old Sabbath, complaining that the new ten-day work cycle was too grueling for "men and animals," as one Valentin Duport of St Martin publicly protested.16 The artisan Claude Bailly of Chinon, in his personal journal, explicitly rejected the new calendar, continuing to use the old dates and linking the reform directly to the "evils of the Revolution" and the Terror.16 This pervasive resistance demonstrated a fundamental miscalculation by the revolutionaries. The calendar was conceived as a rational tool to educate the populace and break the Church's hold on daily life.13 However, it was widely perceived not as liberating but as an oppressive disruption of religious, social, and economic life. The state's inability to enforce its own calendar reveals the stark limits of political power when confronted with deeply embedded cultural norms. The government could execute a king, but it could not easily force a farmer to abandon his Sunday rest.

  

### The Fate of the Clergy: Statistics of Persecution

  

The human cost of the dechristianization campaign was staggering. The pressure on the clergy was immense, enforced by the Law of Suspects (September 17, 1793) and a decree on October 21, 1793, that made all non-juring priests liable to death on sight.1 The statistics paint a grim picture of the persecution. Approximately 20,000 constitutional priests were coerced into abdicating their office and handing over their letters of ordination.1 Of these, between 6,000 and 9,000 were forced to marry, a direct violation of Catholic discipline.1 An estimated 30,000 priests were forced to flee France, while hundreds who remained were executed.1 The campaign was not limited to Catholics; in the Gard department, the hard-line Representative Borie systematically forced 57 Protestant pastors to resign.18

Behind these numbers lie stories of profound personal and spiritual crisis. Some priests capitulated under duress, with figures like the curé of Boissise-la-Bétrand being forced to sign a letter stating, "I am a priest, a curé, that is to say a charlatan".19 Others chose martyrdom. The case of the sixteen Carmelite nuns of Compiègne is among the most famous. On July 17, 1794, they were brought before the guillotine for refusing the oath and continuing to live in a religious community. Accounts claim that they went to their deaths singing hymns like the

Salve Regina or Veni Creator Spiritus, their voices falling silent one by one until the last nun was executed.7 These acts of defiance became powerful symbols of Catholic resilience and were popularly treated as martyrdoms, turning the places of execution into pilgrimage destinations.2

  

### Voices of the People – Rebellion and Resistance

  

The popular response was not limited to passive defiance; in some regions, it exploded into open, violent warfare. The most significant of these uprisings occurred in the devoutly Catholic Vendée region of western France. Sparked by resistance to conscription in March 1793, the revolt quickly became a full-scale religious and royalist counter-revolution.20 The battle cries of the peasant armies were not primarily political but religious: "Vive le roi!" (Long live the king!) and, crucially, "Vive les bons prêtres!" (Long live the good priests!).21 The Republican response was one of annihilation. General François Westerman reported with pride on his army's actions, which, in accordance with a decree of August 2, 1793, involved the systematic destruction and burning of the entire countryside to crush the rebellion.7 The brutality of this suppression, which some scholars have termed the first modern genocide, only hardened resistance and garnered further support for the counter-revolutionary cause.5

While the Vendée was the most extreme example, it was not an isolated case. Resistance to dechristianization flared up across the country, demonstrating that deep attachment to traditional faith was a national, not just a regional, phenomenon. In 1793, in the region of Brie, thousands of citizens gathered at a revolutionary meeting and shouted, “Long live the Catholic Religion, we want our priests, we want the Mass on Sundays, and Holy Days”.23 The departments of Drôme and Ardèche in the southeast also "rebelled openly" against the religious policies.18 More common still was localized, grassroots resistance. Reports from across France indicate that "local people often resisted this dechristianisation and forced members of the clergy who had resigned to conduct mass again".1 This popular pressure created a clandestine church, sustained by the very people the Revolution claimed to represent.

In the vacuum left by the exiled and abdicated clergy, the laity themselves took on a central role in preserving the faith. They became accustomed to taking over services, even performing "white masses"—liturgies without a priest to consecrate the Eucharist.5 This demonstrated a remarkable popular piety that was resilient and adaptive, able to survive even when its formal institutional structure had been shattered. The fragmentation of the response, varying from violent insurrection to quiet continuity, is best understood through a regional lens.

## Part II: The Cult of Reason – An Atheistic Interlude (Autumn 1793 – Spring 1794)

  

As the campaign to dismantle Catholicism reached its peak, a faction of radical revolutionaries attempted to erect a new spiritual edifice in its place. The Cult of Reason was France's first state-sponsored atheistic religion, a chaotic and short-lived experiment that sought to replace God with Man, and faith with rationality. Its rise and rapid fall reveal as much about the factional power struggles within the Revolution as they do about the religious sentiments of the French people.

  

### Philosophy and Proponents

  

The Cult of Reason was not a coherent theology but rather a "hodgepodge of ideas and activities," a "multifarious phenomenon, marked by disorderliness".10 Its chief proponents were radical Jacobins and members of the Paris Commune, including the publisher Jacques Hébert, the public prosecutor Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette, and the organizer Antoine-François Momoro.10 Philosophically, it was an explicitly anthropocentric and atheistic civic religion.10 Its stated goal was the perfection of humanity through the exercise of Reason, which, along with Liberty and Truth, was to be venerated.9

Its promoters were careful to frame this veneration in abstract, philosophical terms to avoid accusations of idolatry. As Momoro explained, "Liberty, reason, truth are only abstract beings. They are not gods, for properly speaking, they are part of ourselves".10 This sentiment was echoed by the radical ideologue Anacharsis Cloots, who declared at a festival that henceforth there would be "one God only,

Le Peuple" (The People).10 The cult's most starkly anti-Christian tenet was promoted by the

représentant en mission Joseph Fouché. In his jurisdictions, Fouché ordered that the sole inscription on cemetery gates must be La mort est un sommeil éternel ("Death is an eternal sleep"), a direct and public refutation of the Christian doctrine of the immortality of the soul and the resurrection.10

  

### The Festival of Reason: A Case Study in Revolutionary Theatre

  

The nationwide Fête de la Raison on 20 Brumaire, Year II (November 10, 1793) came to epitomize the new cult.10 Churches across France were converted into "Temples of Reason," but the grandest ceremony, devised by Chaumette, took place in the former Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris.11 The event was a masterpiece of revolutionary theater, designed to visually and symbolically supplant the old faith.

Inside the cathedral, the Christian altar had been dismantled. In its place stood an altar dedicated to Liberty, before which burned a "torch of Truth".11 The nave was dominated by a large, improvised mountain made of papier-mâché, upon which sat a small Greek temple inscribed "To Philosophy" and decorated with busts of Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire and Rousseau.11 The central figure of the ceremony was the Goddess of Reason, personified by a living woman to avoid the creation of a new idol. In Paris, the role was played by Sophie Momoro, an opera singer and the wife of the organizer.10 She was carried into the cathedral on an ornate palanquin, dressed in the blue, white, and red of the Republic, and seated on the mountain as the crowd sang hymns to Liberty, such as one whose lyrics implored, "Thou, Saint Liberty, inhabit this temple; Be of our nation the Goddess".28

Contemporary accounts from critics of the Revolution, though likely exaggerated, described the festivals as "lurid" and "licentious" affairs.10 They reported scantily clad women dancing the Carmagnole and singing lewd songs, creating a bacchanalian atmosphere that scandalized both conservatives and more moderate revolutionaries.9

  

### Popular Reception and Official Repudiation

  

Despite the grandeur of the Parisian festival and the establishment of Temples of Reason across the country, evidence suggests the cult failed to generate widespread or genuine popular support. While the spectacle may have drawn crowds in radicalized urban centers, its long-term appeal was minimal. Historian Justin Dunn notes that "attendance for civil services and government festivals was chronically low" and, more tellingly, that "parents refused to send their children to be instructed in the new civic religion".30 This indicates a deep-seated resistance to the cult's atheistic principles at the family level, suggesting that while people might be compelled to attend a festival, they would not integrate its teachings into their private lives.

More decisively, the Cult of Reason was doomed by elite condemnation. Its overt atheism and the perceived moral excesses of its festivals appalled key figures in the government. Georges Danton had warned against the "rhetorical excesses" of the dechristianizers, but the most powerful opposition came from Maximilien Robespierre.24 He publicly scorned the festivals as "ridiculous farces" and, along with the Committee of Public Safety, denounced the Hébertists as dangerous extremists and foreign enemies of the Revolution.1

The Cult of Reason was intrinsically tied to the political fortunes of the radical Hébertist faction that championed it.10 Its prominence grew with their influence in the Paris Commune, but its fate was sealed when Robespierre moved to consolidate his own power. The repudiation of the cult was not merely a philosophical disagreement; it was a political purge. In March 1794, the leading proponents of the Cult of Reason—Hébert, Momoro, Chaumette, and their allies—were arrested and sent to the guillotine.9 Their execution marked the definitive end of their creation. The Cult of Reason was officially repudiated and immediately replaced by Robespierre's own, very different, vision of revolutionary spirituality.10

  

## Part III: The Cult of the Supreme Being – Robespierre's Republic of Virtue (Spring-Summer 1794)

  

With the Hébertists eliminated, Robespierre was free to impose his own religious vision on France. The Cult of the Supreme Being was a direct reaction to the atheism of its predecessor. It was a highly organized, deistic state religion designed to provide a moral foundation for the Republic and instill a sense of civic virtue in its citizens. Its centerpiece, a grand festival in Paris, would mark both the apex of Robespierre's power and the beginning of his rapid downfall.

  

### A Deistic State Religion by Decree

  

Robespierre was deeply hostile to atheism, which he considered an aristocratic philosophy that fostered immorality and social disorder.32 He believed that society required a religious foundation and famously echoed Voltaire's sentiment: "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him".32 His goal was to move beyond simple deism to a more rational and virtuous devotion to a godhead, inspired by the civic-minded public virtue he attributed to the ancient Greeks and Romans.32 For Robespierre, Reason was merely a means to an end, and that end was Virtue.32

This vision was codified into law by the National Convention on 18 Floréal, Year II (May 7, 1794). The decree, authored almost entirely by Robespierre, formally established the Cult of the Supreme Being as the civic religion of France. Its foundational articles stated unequivocally: "The French People recognize the existence of the Supreme Being and the Immortality of the Soul".32 The decree went on to define the "only form of worship worthy" of the Supreme Being as "the practice of man's duties," which included detesting tyranny, defending the oppressed, and practicing justice.33 The law also established a new calendar of republican holidays dedicated to abstract virtues such as Truth, Justice, Modesty, and Friendship, to be celebrated on each

décadi (the tenth day of the Republican week).32 The creation of this cult marked a clear reversal of the earlier, more radical dechristianization policies and represented the height of Robespierre's personal power.32

### The Festival of the Supreme Being (June 8, 1794): A Spectacle of Unity and Power

  

To inaugurate his new religion, Robespierre declared that 20 Prairial, Year II (June 8, 1794), which coincided with the Christian holiday of Pentecost, would be the first national celebration of the Supreme Being.32 While every locality was mandated to hold an event, the festival in Paris was designed on a massive scale by the famed revolutionary artist Jacques-Louis David.32 Unlike the more spontaneous festivals of the past, this was a meticulously planned and highly choreographed event intended to project an image of national unity and moral order.

The decree establishing the festival provided painstaking instructions for participants.34 At five in the morning, a general recall was to be sounded, inviting citizens to adorn their houses with tricolor flags and garlands of greenery. Citizens were to march in two columns, six abreast—men and boys on the right, women and girls on the left—each holding an oak branch. Mothers were instructed to carry bouquets of roses, while young girls carried baskets of flowers. All were to be dressed in the "colors of liberty".34 In Paris, "thousands of people flocked to the Tuileries Gardens" for the first part of the ceremony.3 The procession then moved to the Champ de Mars (renamed the Champ de la Réunion), where the main event took place. The centerpiece was an enormous, man-made mountain, fifty feet high, topped with a colossal statue of Hercules and a liberty tree, symbolizing the power of the people and their connection to nature.36 The ceremony began with Robespierre, as President of the Convention, delivering a speech and then setting fire to a large papier-mâché statue representing Atheism. From its ashes, a statue of Wisdom was meant to emerge, though it was reportedly blackened by the smoke.3

  

### Participant Testimonies and Contemporary Assessments

  

Eyewitness accounts of the festival consistently highlight Robespierre's dominant and ostentatious role. He assumed full leadership of the event, forcefully declaring the "social utility" of his new religion.32 Witnesses reported that he "beamed with joy" as he delivered two long speeches, dressed conspicuously in a sky-blue coat and gold-colored nankeen trousers.32 In his first speech, he proclaimed, "The eternally happy day which the French people consecrates to the Supreme Being has finally arrived. Never has the world he created offered him a sight so worthy of his eyes".34 He concluded his second speech with a call to arms that blended deism with the ongoing Terror: "People, let us surrender ourselves today... to the just ecstasy of pure joy. Tomorrow we shall again combat vices and tyrants".34

However, this spectacle of personal power provoked immediate backlash. While the crowds may have participated, their enthusiasm was not universally for Robespierre himself. The most telling piece of evidence from the day is an anonymous but widely reported testimony of a spectator's murmur: "Look at the blackguard; it's not enough for him to be master, he has to be God".32 This single quote captures the critical shift in public perception. Robespierre's attempt to position himself as the high priest of the Republic was seen not as an act of piety but as one of supreme arrogance. The English observer Helen Maria Williams dismissed the event in her letters as the "insincerity of the Festival of the Supreme Being".40 This sentiment was shared by Robespierre's political rivals on the Committee of General Security, such as Vadier and Fouché, who openly criticized him and, in Fouché's case, predicted his imminent fall.32

The Festival of the Supreme Being, intended to be the crowning achievement of Robespierre's Republic of Virtue, was in fact a profound political miscalculation. It was designed to unify the nation under his moral leadership, but his god-like centrality to the proceedings crystallized the growing fear that he was becoming a dictator. The spectacle of power was so overwhelming that it became perceived as a threat to the very Republic it claimed to celebrate. The contemporary assessment of Madame de Staël proved prophetic: "it was from that time he was lost".32 The festival, far from securing his position, directly contributed to the Thermidorian Reaction. Less than two months later, on July 28, 1794, Robespierre was overthrown and executed. With his death, the Cult of the Supreme Being lost all official sanction and vanished from public view.32

  

## Conclusion: The Legacy of a Failed Transformation

  

The popular response to the religious experiments of the French Revolution was, in the final analysis, a testament to the resilience of traditional belief and the limits of state power to engineer the human spirit. There was no single, unified reaction. Instead, the evidence reveals a complex mosaic of responses determined by regional loyalties, class interests, and individual piety. The Dechristianization Campaign was met with violent, religiously motivated rebellion in the Vendée, vocal public protest in Brie, and widespread passive resistance across the nation, most notably in the popular rejection of the Republican Calendar. The revolutionary cults, for all their state-sponsored pageantry, failed to achieve genuine, lasting adherence. The grand festivals in Paris drew crowds, but attendance at regular civic services was low, and the new doctrines were largely rejected at the family level.30

The long-standing scholarly debate over whether these policies were imposed from the top down or grew from the bottom up finds a nuanced resolution in the evidence. The initiatives were undeniably conceived and driven by a radical political elite in Paris, first by the Hébertists and then by Robespierre.1 However, their reception was entirely contingent on local conditions. In some urban areas with a history of anti-clericalism, the policies found fertile ground. In the devoutly Catholic countryside, they provoked a powerful and often violent traditionalist backlash.5 The revolutionary program was imposed from the top, but its success or failure was ultimately decided from the bottom up, parish by parish.

The ultimate failure of the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme Being demonstrated that a religion cannot be created by decree. After the fall of Robespierre and the end of the Terror, the French population quickly returned to familiar forms of worship. A law passed on February 21, 1795, legalized public worship once again, albeit with strict limitations.1 The entire tumultuous episode, however, permanently altered the relationship between church and state in France. It culminated in Napoleon Bonaparte's Concordat of 1801, which formally ended the dechristianization period. The Concordat recognized Catholicism not as the state religion, but as "the religion of the vast majority of French citizens," cementing a new, subordinate, and state-funded role for the Church that would last for a century.1 The radical attempt to erase Christianity had failed, but in doing so, it had shattered the foundations of the

Ancien Régime's fusion of throne and altar, inadvertently laying the groundwork for the enduring French principle of laïcité.1
