## üí° Introduction

  

The French Revolution's approach to its religious minorities presents one of the most profound paradoxes in the history of modern state formation. In a breathtakingly short span, the revolutionary authorities propelled Protestants and Jews from a state of legally enforced inferiority to one of full, active citizenship, making France the first European country to emancipate its Jewish population.1 Yet, this very same revolutionary fervor, in its radical phase, unleashed a campaign of Dechristianization that saw Protestant temples and Jewish synagogues closed, their clergy and leaders persecuted, and their ancient traditions suppressed in the name of a new, secular public order.3 This report posits that this dramatic reversal was not an aberration but a core expression of the revolutionary project. The handling of Jews and Protestants reveals the centralizing, homogenizing impulse of the nascent French nation-state, which sought to forge a unified citizenry by dissolving all intermediary loyalties and corporate identities.

This analysis will trace the trajectory of these minorities from the fragmented legal landscape of the Ancien R√©gime, through the contentious debates and legislative acts of emancipation, to their paradoxical persecution during the Reign of Terror. It will provide a granular examination of the methods of social transformation employed by the revolutionary government, detailing the specific decrees, the organizational structures like the Jacobin Clubs that enforced them, and the new civic cults designed to replace traditional religion. By dissecting the experiences of Protestants in the south and Jews in Alsace and Avignon, this report will demonstrate that the price of inclusion in the new French nation was the demand for total assimilation, a bargain that ultimately pitted the Revolution's universalist ideals against its own violent quest for uniformity.

  

## üëë Part I: The Ancien R√©gime's Legacy: A Fractured Landscape of Tolerance and Intolerance

  

To understand the revolutionary experience of France's religious minorities, one must first grasp their deeply fragmented and unequal status under the Ancien R√©gime. The conditions for Protestants, Sephardic Jews, and Ashkenazi Jews were so distinct that they were treated by the monarchy, and later the revolutionaries, as entirely separate cases.

  

### ‚õ™ The Status of Protestants: A Century of Suppression and Slow Re-emergence

  

For French Protestants, or Huguenots, the century preceding the Revolution was defined by the trauma of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685.6 This act made Protestantism illegal, forcing its adherents to worship in secret in what became known as the "Church of the Desert".8 Persecution relaxed somewhat under Louis XV, but the legal proscription remained.9

A critical step toward change came with the Edict of Versailles on November 7, 1787, often called the Edict of Tolerance.9 Signed by Louis XVI, this act was a product of Enlightenment pressure and represented a significant, if incomplete, reform. It granted non-Catholics a civil status, allowing them to legally contract marriages, register births, and own property without having to convert to Catholicism.10 However, the edict was explicit in its limitations: it denied Protestants political rights and forbade public worship.9 Roman Catholicism remained the state religion.9 Thus, on the eve of 1789, full membership in the French state was still denied to the Protestant minority.13 Unsurprisingly, most Protestants initially welcomed the Revolution, seeing it as the vehicle to secure the full rights that the monarchy had only partially granted, and many hoped it would result in a constitutional monarchy that would protect their freedoms.7

  

### ‚ú°Ô∏è The Status of Jews: A "Nation Within a Nation"

  

On the eve of the Revolution, France's Jewish population numbered approximately 40,000 to 50,000.1 They were not a monolithic entity but were divided into two main communities whose legal, cultural, and social integration levels differed dramatically. This pre-existing fragmentation was not merely a background detail but a primary causal factor that would dictate the staggered and contentious nature of their emancipation.

The Sephardic Jews, numbering around 3,500, were concentrated in southwestern France, particularly in Bordeaux and Bayonne.5 Descendants of refugees from the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions, they were generally wealthier and more culturally assimilated than their eastern counterparts. They were active as merchants and, by 1776, had succeeded in establishing their status as a recognized merchant guild in Bordeaux.5 Their relative integration meant that revolutionary leaders like Talleyrand would later argue for their citizenship on the grounds that they were "culturally and socially already not alien".5

In stark contrast were the Ashkenazi Jews, who comprised the vast majority of the Jewish population, with roughly 30,000 living in the eastern provinces of Alsace and Lorraine.5 This community was far more isolated, spoke Yiddish, and maintained a strong adherence to traditional Jewish life.5 They lived under a corporate structure, with their own rabbinic courts in cities like Metz serving as the court of first jurisdiction for all civil matters involving Jews.5 While this afforded them a degree of autonomy, it also reinforced their status as a separate body within the kingdom‚Äîa "nation within a nation"‚Äîa concept anathema to the revolutionary ideal of a unified state.5

The Ashkenazim faced severe economic and social restrictions. They were largely barred from owning land and from most guilds, relegating them to petty trade, cattle dealing, and, most controversially, moneylending, which frequently embroiled them in conflicts with the local peasantry.1 They were also subjected to humiliating special taxes, such as a poll tax (abolished in 1785) and an annual levy of 20,000 livres on the Jews of Metz.15 A 1784 royal decree aimed at the Jews of Alsace was particularly harsh, imposing new restrictions on their economic activities and marriage rights and even ordering a census in preparation for the expulsion of those who could not prove their legal right of residence.5

  

### üí° The Influence of the Enlightenment and the "Regeneration" Debate

  

The intellectual currents of the Enlightenment set the stage for a radical rethinking of the status of minorities. Figures like the Abb√© Henri Gr√©goire and the Comte de Mirabeau championed the cause of Jewish rights, arguing that the perceived "defects" of the Jews were not inherent but were the direct result of centuries of Christian persecution and legal degradation.1

This argument gave rise to the pivotal concept of "regeneration." The central question was not simply whether to grant rights, but how to "regenerate" the Jews to make them worthy of those rights. This was the explicit theme of a famous 1787 essay contest sponsored by the Royal Society of Science and Arts of Metz, which asked: "What are the best means to make the Jews happier and more useful in France?".1 The winning essays, including one by Abb√© Gr√©goire and another by the Polish-Jewish activist Zalkind Hourwitz, argued for emancipation as the path to "improvement".1

This framework of regeneration, while presented as philanthropic, was double-edged. It provided a powerful justification for granting citizenship, but it did so by positioning traditional Jewish culture and communal life as a problem to be solved. It implied that Jewishness, in its corporate and religiously distinct form, was incompatible with French citizenship. This logic established an intellectual precedent for state intervention into the lives of minorities, not merely to grant rights but to "reform" and assimilate them into a national model. This ideological groundwork‚Äîthat the state has a role in "improving" its citizens‚Äîprovided a potent justification for the later, more coercive measures of the Terror, which sought to forcibly strip away these distinctive cultural traits in the name of republican virtue.

  

## üìú Part II: The Promise of Emancipation: Defining the Citizen, 1789-1791

  

The first years of the Revolution saw the abstract principles of the Enlightenment collide with the complex realities of French society. For religious minorities, this period was defined by a contentious, staggered, and ultimately conditional process of emancipation. The debates over their status became a proxy war for the very definition of French citizenship, pitting the universalist logic of natural rights against the powerful, particularist demand for national uniformity.

  

### üèõÔ∏è The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (August 26, 1789)

  

The foundational document of the Revolution, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, proclaimed universal principles intended to apply to all.18 For religious minorities, the most crucial article was the tenth:

"No one may be disquieted for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their manifestation does not trouble the public order established by the law." 19

This article established freedom of conscience as a fundamental right. However, its promise was immediately qualified by the ambiguous clause concerning "public order." This phrase created a significant loophole, granting the state the power to define which religious manifestations were acceptable and which were deemed a threat to civic unity. While celebrated as a victory for tolerance, this clause would later be ruthlessly exploited during the Reign of Terror to justify the suppression of all public worship.19 Furthermore, despite its universalist language, the Declaration was not initially interpreted as automatically extending full citizenship to France's Jewish population, whose status required further debate.5

  

### ‚öñÔ∏è The Legislative Process: A Staggered and Contentious Path to Citizenship

  

The path to full citizenship was not uniform. It reflected the revolutionaries' prejudiced hierarchy of "assimilability," granting rights first to those groups they perceived as less alien to the French national character.

Protestants were the first to benefit. Having already gained civil status in 1787, they were granted full political rights and eligibility for all offices on December 24, 1789.11 Their case was relatively straightforward; their primary difference was theological, and they were not seen as constituting a separate "nation" within France.

The emancipation of the Jews, however, was far more controversial and unfolded in two distinct stages, revealing the deep anxieties surrounding their communal identity. The issue was first formally debated in the National Assembly from December 21-24, 1789, alongside the status of other marginalized groups like actors and executioners.25 The arguments articulated in these sessions defined the terms of the debate for the next two years.

The core of the assimilationist contract was famously articulated by Count Stanislas de Clermont-Tonnerre in a speech on December 23, 1789:

"We must refuse everything to the Jews as a nation and accord everything to Jews as individuals... We must withdraw recognition from their judges; they should only have our judges... They must not be allowed to form in the state either a political body or an order. They must be citizens individually." 5

This was the explicit offer: citizenship in exchange for the complete dissolution of the autonomous Jewish community (kehillah). It was a demand for Jews to cease being a collective entity with their own laws and institutions and to become indistinguishable from other Frenchmen in the public sphere. Proponents like Maximilien Robespierre supported this outcome, arguing from a universalist position that Jewish "vices" were the product of persecution and could not be used to deny them the "sacred rights that the title of man bestows upon him".26

Opponents, led by figures like Abb√© Jean-Siffrein Maury, rejected this view, framing the Jews as an unassimilable foreign body. Maury declared:

"The word Jew is not the name of a sect, but of a nation... Calling Jews citizens would be like saying that without letters of naturalization and without ceasing to be English and Danish, the English and Danish could become French." 5

This deep ideological divide led to a legislative impasse. The Assembly granted rights to Protestants but explicitly postponed the decision on the Jews.16 This prompted a petition from the more integrated "Portuguese" Jews of Bordeaux and Avignon, who felt that the Revolution had, for them, been a regression, as they had participated in the elections for an Assembly that now denied them rights.16 Seizing on this opportunity to deal with the "easier" case, the Assembly, with the support of Talleyrand, voted to grant citizenship to the Sephardic communities on

January 28, 1790.5 The vote was a narrow 374 to 280, demonstrating the significant resistance even to this limited measure.23

The Ashkenazi Jews of Alsace and Lorraine had to wait nearly two more years. Their emancipation came only in the final days of the National Assembly, on September 27, 1791.5 The final decree was passed on the grounds of revolutionary consistency: it was impossible to complete a revolution based on universal rights while leaving one group of men unequal.5 The official law, a copy of which is preserved at the Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda√Øsme, made the contractual nature of this emancipation explicit.28 It revoked all previous exceptions and stipulated that the taking of the civic oath "shall be regarded as a renunciation of all privileges and exceptions previously inserted in their favor".29 The "privileges" being renounced were the rights of the autonomous Jewish community. This act was a clear demonstration of a core revolutionary technique: the maximization of state power by breaking down all intermediary allegiances to create a direct, unmediated relationship between the state and the individual citizen.

  

## ‚öîÔ∏è Part III: The Terror and Dechristianization: The Revolution Devours Its Own Principles, 1793-1794

  

The period from the autumn of 1793 to the summer of 1794, known as the Reign of Terror, marked a violent reversal of the Revolution's initial promise of religious freedom. Driven by fears of internal and external enemies, the state initiated a radical campaign of Dechristianization that aimed to eradicate all forms of traditional religion and replace them with a new civic faith. While primarily aimed at the Catholic Church, this campaign swept up Protestants and Jews in its wake, subjecting them to a new form of persecution at the hands of the very state that had just declared them equal citizens.

  

### üè≠ The Machinery of Suppression: From Paris to the Provinces

  

The Terror was not a spontaneous outburst of violence but an organized policy implemented through a powerful state apparatus. At its head was the Committee of Public Safety, created in April 1793, which became the de facto executive government of France, wielding near-dictatorial power.30

The Committee's decrees were implemented and enforced across the country through two primary channels:

1. The Jacobin Clubs: By 1793, a vast network of 5,000 to 8,000 affiliated clubs, with a nominal membership of 500,000, acted as the eyes and ears of the Revolution in the provinces. They served as centers for propaganda, public surveillance, and the organization of revolutionary festivals, ensuring that the will of Paris was felt in every corner of France.32
    
2. Repr√©sentants en mission: These were deputies sent from the National Convention to the provinces with extraordinary powers to enforce revolutionary laws, purge local administrations, and crush counter-revolution. Figures like Joseph Fouch√© in Nevers and Borie in the Gard were often the driving force behind the most radical dechristianization measures, such as forcing priests to abdicate and closing churches.30
    

The communication flow was not simply top-down. Provincial Jacobin clubs and representatives often initiated radical actions, which were then reported back to Paris via correspondence.35 The central authorities in Paris would then react, sometimes endorsing the radicalism and other times, as with Robespierre's later denunciations, attempting to rein it in.22 This created a dynamic and often chaotic feedback loop that fueled the intensity of the campaign.

  

### ‚õ™ The Protestant Experience: From Allies to Victims

  

Despite having been early and enthusiastic supporters of the Revolution, Protestants found themselves targeted by a campaign that eventually made no distinction between forms of Christianity.14 The closure of temples became widespread; worship was suspended "almost everywhere".3 In the spring of 1793, the main Protestant church in Paris was among the first to be closed.7 Worship was driven back underground, into private homes and family settings, reminiscent of the "Church of the Desert" era, or was maintained only in the protected chapels of foreign embassies.30

A key tactic of suppression was the forced resignation of pastors. The numbers reveal a systematic effort: of 215 active pastors in 1793, 98 were forced to abdicate, with three-quarters of these resignations occurring in the Protestant heartlands of the South-East.30 The department of the

Gard was a particular focus of this pressure; there, 57 pastors resigned, an action attributed directly to the hard-line repr√©sentant en mission Borie, who systematically compelled them to do so.30 The vast majority of these abdications were under duress, and most pastors sought to resume their ministry immediately after the fall of Robespierre.30

The persecution escalated from suppression to lethal violence. Protestants, particularly in the south, were often associated with the moderate Girondin faction and the Federalist revolts of 1793, making them political targets for the radical Jacobins.38 In the district of the

Gard, a region with a large Protestant population, revolutionaries guillotined 150 people during the Terror; of these, an astonishing 117 were Protestants.7 Notable victims included five Protestant deputies to the Convention, among them the eloquent pastor and champion of religious freedom,

Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-√âtienne, a native of the Gard.30 This demonstrates that in certain regions, Protestants were not just collateral damage but were disproportionately targeted, their religious identity intertwined with accusations of political and economic crimes.

  

### ‚ú°Ô∏è The Jewish Paradox: Citizenship Under Siege

  

For the Jewish community, the Dechristianization campaign created a deeply paradoxical situation. Having just been granted citizenship, they were now confronted with a state that sought to erase the public expression of the very identity they had been asked to subordinate, but not abandon. The logic of the Terror held that any public display of a separate identity‚Äîany tradition that "troubled the public order"‚Äîwas inherently anti-republican.5

Consequently, synagogues were closed and their property confiscated across France.

- In Avignon, which had been annexed from the Papal States in 1791, Judaism was declared "outlawed" during the Terror. The community's synagogue was seized by the city and designated "national property".4
    
- In Alsace, the impact was widespread. Many synagogues and other Jewish communal properties were nationalized. Communities were forced to surrender their silver ritual objects or hide them, along with sacred books and Torah scrolls.5 On  
    June 27, 1794, the authorities in Strasbourg forbade Jews from using their traditional cemetery at Rosenviller.39
    
- In Carpentras, the Jewish community "willingly" handed over its synagogue to the authorities in 1794, an act that undoubtedly occurred under extreme duress.5
    

The pressure to conform extended to core religious practices. An invaluable primary source, the pinkas (ledger) of Avraham Freimann, a mohel (ritual circumciser) in Alsace, provides a vivid eyewitness account of the daily fears. He records an entry for August 19, 1794, in the town of Bischheim, where he had to hurry a circumcision ceremony because of a threatened riot by a mob from the neighboring village of La Wantzenau, who intended to destroy the synagogue. He concludes the entry with relief, writing, "God foiled their evil plot".40

Local Jacobin clubs were often at the forefront of this pressure. The club in Colmar protested against Jews observing the Sabbath by refraining from work. In a striking example of internalized revolutionary pressure, the Jacobin club in Saint-Esprit-l√®s-Bayonne, which was composed mostly of Jews, forbade its own members from wearing Sabbath garments or lighting Sabbath candles.39

Despite this intense cultural and religious persecution, a crucial distinction remains. While some Jews were executed during the Terror for political or economic reasons, the evidence suggests that "no Jew was guillotined during the Terror for religious 'obduracy'".5 This stands in stark contrast to the fate of Catholic priests and even some Protestant leaders. The revolutionaries appear to have operated with a hierarchy of perceived threats. Nonjuring Catholic priests were seen as an active political threat due to their allegiance to Rome and the old order. Protestants in regions like the Gard were viewed as a political threat due to their association with federalism. Jews, however, were primarily seen as a

social threat; their distinct traditions and communal solidarity were deemed "antisocial" and contrary to the ideal of a single, indivisible nation. The methods of suppression were thus tailored to the perceived threat: execution for political enemies, but intense social and cultural pressure for those deemed merely alien.

This period of intense persecution had an unforeseen and deeply ironic consequence. By attacking all religions with equal fervor, the radical state inadvertently created what one historian has termed an "ecumenism of blood".7 For centuries, Protestants and Jews had been persecuted

by a Catholic-dominated state. During the Terror, Catholics, Protestants, and Jews found themselves persecuted together by a secular state. This shared experience of suffering at the hands of a common enemy fundamentally altered the dynamics of religious relations in France, mitigating some of the old sectarian animosities and creating a common cause in the face of state-sponsored terror.7

  

## üõê Part IV: The New Republican Faith: Symbols, Rituals, and Revolutionary Cults

  

The Dechristianization campaign was not merely a destructive project; it was also a constructive one. The revolutionaries understood that to transform society, they could not simply leave a vacuum where the Catholic Church had been. They needed to create a new system of belief, complete with its own rituals, symbols, and moral framework, to bind the citizen to the Republic. This led to the creation of two successive state-sponsored secular religions: the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme Being.

  

### üß† The Cult of Reason: An Atheistic Experiment

  

Emerging in the autumn of 1793 and championed by radical factions like the Paris Commune and the H√©bertists, the Cult of Reason was the first organized attempt to create a revolutionary religion.41 It was explicitly atheistic, rejecting all godheads and instead worshipping the abstract concept of Reason itself.22

Its most famous expression was the Festival of Reason, held in the former Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris on November 10, 1793 (20 Brumaire, Year II).22 The ceremony was a masterclass in symbolic replacement. The Christian altar was dismantled and replaced with an altar to Liberty. The inscription "To Philosophy" was carved over the cathedral's doors. Inside the nave, which was now designated a "Temple of Reason," an artificial mountain was constructed, topped with a Greek temple. The centerpiece of the ceremony was an actress, dressed in the tricolor, personifying the Goddess of Reason.13 Similar festivals were organized in the provinces, as churches and cathedrals were converted into Temples of Reason in cities like Autun and Blois, where local Jacobins delivered speeches inaugurating the new cult.43

The Cult of Reason, however, proved too radical for many. Its atheism and the often "licentious" and "lurid" nature of its festivals provoked a strong backlash.41 Maximilien Robespierre, in particular, viewed the movement with contempt, dismissing its ceremonies as "ridiculous farces" and seeing its atheism as a philosophy of aristocrats that threatened to alienate the devout common people from the Revolution.37

  

### üåü The Cult of the Supreme Being: Robespierre's Deistic Counter-Move

  

In response to the perceived excesses of the Cult of Reason, Robespierre launched his own religious project. A fervent disciple of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Robespierre believed that a belief in a higher power and an afterlife was essential for social order and public virtue.37 He saw reason as merely a means to an end, with that end being virtue.37

On May 7, 1794 (18 Flor√©al, Year II), Robespierre had the National Convention pass a decree establishing the Cult of the Supreme Being as the new state religion of France.30 Its core tenets were simple and deistic: belief in the existence of a Supreme Being and the immortality of the soul. Crucially, worship was to be expressed not through traditional prayer but through the practice of civic duties: "to detest bad faith and tyranny, to punish tyrants and traitors,... to defend the oppressed, [and] to do unto others all the good one can".37

The cult was inaugurated with a massive, meticulously planned Festival of the Supreme Being in Paris on June 8, 1794. Designed by the artist Jacques-Louis David, the festival was the apotheosis of Robespierre's power. Dressed in a symbolic sky-blue coat, he led a procession from the Tuileries Garden, where he set fire to a statue representing Atheism, to an enormous artificial mountain on the Champ de Mars. There, he delivered speeches proclaiming his vision of a republic guided by a deistic god, a god with "no Christ, no Mohammed".37

The conflict between these two cults was more than a theological dispute; it was a proxy for the deadly power struggle within the Jacobin elite. Robespierre used his cult to denounce and destroy his political rivals, the atheistic H√©bertists.37 However, his prominent, almost pontifical role in the June 8th festival backfired catastrophically. His enemies used it as evidence that he was developing grandiose delusions, aiming to become not just a dictator but a high priest of a new religion.37 This suspicion contributed directly to the Thermidorian Reaction, which saw him overthrown and executed just over a month later, on July 28, 1794. With his death, the Cult of the Supreme Being lost its patron and vanished from public view. Both cults were officially banned by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802.41

  

## üìä Part V: Conclusion: An Assessment of Revolutionary Transformation

  

The French Revolution's handling of its religious minorities offers a series of powerful and enduring insights into the mechanisms of radical social change. The journey from the promise of emancipation to the persecution of the Terror was not a detour from the revolutionary path but a direct consequence of its core methods and ideologies. An analysis of this paradoxical experience yields several key conclusions regarding mass mobilization, institutional replacement, and the fraught relationship between universalist ideals and their practical implementation.

First, the Revolution demonstrates that successful mass mobilization relies on a potent combination of universalist ideology and a dense organizational network. The ideals of libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√© provided a powerful moral and philosophical justification for upending the old order. However, these ideas alone were insufficient. It was the network of Jacobin Clubs that translated the decrees of Paris into action on the ground, creating a system of surveillance and enforcement that reached into every town and village.33 This structure was not a simple top-down hierarchy but a dynamic feedback loop, where provincial radicalism often forced the hand of the center, showing that effective mobilization requires both a compelling message and a robust, responsive organizational structure.35

Second, the revolutionary project mastered the use of symbols and rituals to achieve institutional replacement. The revolutionaries understood that to destroy the Ancien R√©gime, they had to supplant its entire system of meaning. This was achieved through a systematic campaign of symbolic substitution: the Christian calendar was replaced by the Republican calendar; churches were physically repurposed into Temples of Reason; and religious holidays were supplanted by secular festivals celebrating civic virtues.22 The Festivals of Reason and the Supreme Being were the ultimate expression of this technique‚Äîa deliberate attempt to create a new, state-sanctioned religion to provide the social cohesion once furnished by the Church.13 This illustrates a fundamental principle of social transformation: old institutions are most effectively replaced not when they are simply destroyed, but when they are superseded by new institutions that fulfill their social and psychological functions.

Third, the core method for forging the new nation-state was the dissolution of all intermediary corporate bodies to create an unmediated relationship between the individual and the state. The famous dictum of Clermont-Tonnerre‚Äî"to the Jews as a nation, nothing; to the Jews as individuals, everything"‚Äîwas the clearest articulation of this principle.25 Emancipation was offered as a contract: individual rights were granted in exchange for the renunciation of collective identity and communal autonomy.29 This policy was applied to both the Jewish

kehillah and the Catholic Church, whose corporate wealth was nationalized and whose clergy were made employees of the state.22 This method reveals the centralizing logic of the modern nation-state, which seeks to become the primary object of loyalty for all its citizens.

Finally, the experience of Protestants and Jews serves as a stark case study in the immense and often tragic gap between universalist ideology and its practical implementation. The promise of individual freedom of conscience, enshrined in the 1789 Declaration of Rights, was ultimately sacrificed to the radical demand for absolute public conformity to a singular, secular, national ideal. The "public order" clause of Article X became the justification for suppressing any practice‚Äîfrom Sabbath observance to public worship‚Äîthat marked a group as different.19 In their violent quest to forge a unified and indivisible Republic, the revolutionaries ended up devouring the very principles of liberty they claimed to champion. The journey of France's religious minorities through the Revolution stands as a powerful historical lesson on the inherent tensions within any mass movement that seeks to engineer a new society, demonstrating that the road to a universal "mankind" is often paved with the persecution of actual men.
