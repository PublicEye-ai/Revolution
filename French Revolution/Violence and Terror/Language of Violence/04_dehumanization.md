# The People's Avenger, The Nation's Filth: Dehumanization as a Tool of Mobilization in the French Revolution

  
  

## Introduction: The Revolution and the Weaponization of Contempt

  

The French Revolution stands as a watershed moment not only in the history of political structures but in the history of political communication. The decade following 1789 witnessed the systematic demolition of the foundational pillars of the Ancien Régime—a divinely ordained monarchy, a privileged clergy, and a hereditary aristocracy.1 This demolition was accomplished not merely by force of arms or legislative decree, but by a concurrent and arguably more fundamental campaign of symbolic destruction. This report argues that the dehumanization of political and social enemies was not an unfortunate or incidental byproduct of revolutionary fervor, but a calculated, central, and indispensable technique for political mobilization, the consolidation of power, and the justification of mass violence. It was a process that weaponized language and imagery to redraw the very boundaries of the human community, determining who belonged to the regenerated French nation and who constituted a form of pollution to be purged.

The collapse of the old order created a profound symbolic and political vacuum. Into this void rushed a new, vibrant, and chaotic revolutionary political culture.2 This culture found its expression in an unprecedented explosion of print media—journals, pamphlets, and caricatures—and new forums for political discourse, such as the network of clubs and societies that spread across the nation.2 It was within this new public sphere that political identities were forged, agendas were advanced, and, most critically, enemies were defined. The Revolution provides a stark and early confirmation of a key principle of modern political violence: "dehumanisation invariably starts with language".4 This language was not simply insulting or hyperbolic; it was a premeditated tool designed to achieve what psychologists term "moral disengagement," a necessary cognitive step that allows individuals to perpetrate inhuman acts while preserving a sense of righteousness.4

This report will document and analyze this process by examining the primary conduits through which dehumanizing propaganda was conceived and disseminated. First, the radical press, particularly the newspapers of Jacques-René Hébert and Jean-Paul Marat, which gave voice to popular rage and provided a daily lexicon of contempt.3 Second, the national network of political clubs, most notably the Jacobins, which functioned as a vast echo chamber, amplifying and localizing Parisian propaganda to mobilize the provinces.6 Third, the political oratory of revolutionary leaders like Maximilien Robespierre, who cloaked the bloody imperatives of the street in the elevated language of philosophy, giving moral and intellectual legitimacy to violence.8 Finally, the public spectacle of the guillotine, which served as the ultimate ritual, enacting the physical purgation of the dehumanized enemy before a mobilized and participatory populace.10 By tracing the path from dehumanizing word to violent deed, this analysis will demonstrate that the redefinition of the "enemy" as subhuman was a core organizational method of the French Revolution.

  

## Section I: The Anatomy of Dehumanization: A Theoretical Framework

  

To comprehend the function of enemy-making during the French Revolution, it is essential to first establish a clear theoretical framework for the concept of dehumanization. Far from being a simple expression of dislike or disagreement, dehumanization is a complex psychological and social process that fundamentally alters the perception of a targeted group, with profound consequences for moral behavior. Understanding its mechanisms is crucial to grasping how revolutionary rhetoric translated into revolutionary violence.

  

### Defining Dehumanization

  

At its core, dehumanization is the practice of denying full and complete humanity to other individuals or groups, thereby placing them outside the "bounds of moral concern".12 It is any act of thought or depiction that regards a person as both "other than" and "less than" human.12 This distinguishes it from related phenomena like prejudice or stigmatization. While a stigmatized group may be disliked or marginalized, they are still typically recognized as normatively human; the dehumanized, by contrast, are perceived as lacking the essential qualities that define humanity, such as complex emotions, rationality, and moral capacity.12 This process can manifest in two primary forms: absolute dehumanization, which involves perceiving a group as entirely devoid of human qualities, and relative dehumanization, which entails attributing fewer human characteristics to one group in comparison to another.12 In either form, the result is a diminishment of the target's moral and mental worth, rendering their suffering irrelevant.12

  

### Psychological Mechanisms: Moral Disengagement and Enemy Imaging

  

Dehumanization operates as a powerful psychological mechanism that facilitates violence and cruelty.12 By stripping a target of their humanity, it weakens or removes the innate psychological restraints—such as empathy, compassion, and guilt—that normally inhibit aggression against fellow human beings.13 This process of "moral exclusion" makes inhumane treatment seem not only acceptable but, in many cases, justified and necessary for the protection of the in-group.13

This is often achieved through the construction of a stark "enemy image".13 During protracted conflicts, adversarial attitudes harden, and parties begin to attribute uniformly negative and malicious traits to their opponents. The enemy image is typically black and white: the opponent's actions are seen as flowing from a fundamentally evil nature, while one's own faults are ignored or rationalized.13 This cognitive distortion makes it difficult to empathize with the opponent or to perceive any common ground, rendering meaningful communication impossible and escalating the conflict. Dehumanization is the most extreme form of this enemy imaging, moving beyond the attribution of negative human traits to the complete denial of shared humanity.

  

### Forms of Dehumanization

  

The denial of humanity can be expressed through several distinct, though often overlapping, rhetorical and symbolic strategies. These forms provide a useful typology for analyzing the specific language and imagery employed by French revolutionaries.

- Animalistic Dehumanization: This is the most blatant and historically common form, involving overt and explicit comparisons of people to non-human animals.12 Targets are likened to "vermin," "insects," "beasts," "dogs," or "reptiles".4 Such metaphors are psychologically potent because they imply that the targeted group lacks the higher faculties associated with humanity—reason, culture, morality, and self-control—and operates purely on base instinct. This framing directly suggests that the group is a pestilence or a predatory threat that must be controlled or exterminated for the safety of the human community.
    
- Mechanistic Dehumanization and Objectification: This form involves portraying others as inanimate objects, machines, or tools.12 By reducing a person to an object, this type of dehumanization denies their agency, emotional depth, and individuality. It is the opposite of personification; it is the "disendowment" of human qualities.12
    
- Demonic Dehumanization: This strategy attributes supernatural evil to the enemy, casting them not merely as political opponents but as monstrous, satanic, or demonic forces that threaten the natural, moral, or divine order.4 This framing elevates the conflict to a cosmic struggle between absolute good and absolute evil, justifying any and all measures to defeat the demonic foe.
    

The power of these narratives during the Revolution was amplified by a crucial social dynamic. Dehumanization is rarely a spontaneous mass delusion; it is typically a directed process that relies on what philosopher David Livingstone Smith terms "epistemic deference".15 In times of great uncertainty and social upheaval, people look to figures of authority to make sense of the world. The collapse of the

Ancien Régime created just such a moment of disorientation. In this vacuum, new revolutionary authorities emerged—radical journalists like Marat and Hébert, and political orators like Robespierre. They positioned themselves as the true "friends of the people" and the authentic interpreters of the revolutionary will.16 The populace, desperate for clarity and leadership in a world turned upside down, largely deferred to the judgments of these new "experts" on patriotism and treason. When these leaders defined a group—aristocrats, priests, hoarders—as subhuman, the mobilized and anxious public was psychologically primed to accept these definitions as truth. The process was not simply one of propaganda persuading a skeptical audience, but of a disoriented audience willingly deferring to the narratives provided by its new leaders, which in turn explains the astonishing speed and breadth with which the most extreme rhetoric was adopted.

  

## Section II: The Pantheon of the Condemned: Identifying the "Enemies of the People"

  

The effectiveness of the revolutionary campaign of dehumanization lay in its ability to clearly identify targets. However, the definition of the "enemy" was not static; it was a fluid and expanding category, strategically manipulated to serve the shifting political objectives of the ascendant factions. What began as a focused assault on the symbols of the old order evolved into a generalized suspicion that could fall upon anyone, transforming the charge of "enemy of the people" into a potent and adaptable political weapon.

  

### The Ancien Régime as the Primal Enemy

  

The initial and most obvious targets of revolutionary ire were the "three pillars" of the Ancien Régime: the monarchy, the clergy, and the aristocracy.1 The entire social structure was framed as an unjust system in which the first two Estates—the clergy and the nobility—were parasitic, corrupt, and oppressive, living off the labor of the vastly larger Third Estate.1 Pre-revolutionary critiques described a "despotic and weak" monarchy, a "corrupt and worldly church," and an "increasingly parasitical" nobility, all contributing to a state of financial and administrative anarchy.1 This narrative cast the privileged orders not as legitimate social bodies but as a dead weight on the nation, a burden that had to be thrown off for France to be reborn. This clear, class-based definition of the enemy provided the initial momentum for the Revolution, uniting the diverse elements of the Third Estate, from the peasantry to the wealthy bourgeoisie, against a common and easily identifiable oppressor.2

  

### The Widening Gyre: From Royalists to Revolutionaries

  

As the Revolution progressed and radicalized, the definition of the "enemy" expanded beyond the traditional elites to encompass anyone perceived as a threat to the new order, including those who had initially supported the changes.

- The Monarchy: For the first years of the Revolution, a constitutional monarchy remained a possibility. However, the royal family's failed attempt to flee Paris in June 1791—the flight to Varennes—was a pivotal turning point. This act was widely interpreted as treason, shattering the remaining trust in the king. In the radical press and political clubs, Louis XVI was transformed from a flawed but potentially reformable sovereign into a "vile perjurer" and a "cowardly deserter" actively conspiring with foreign powers against his own people.16 Marie Antoinette, long unpopular and derided for her Austrian origins, was similarly cast as a central figure in this counter-revolutionary plot.16
    
- The Clergy: The Civil Constitution of the Clergy in 1790 split the church, forcing priests to choose between loyalty to the state and loyalty to Rome. Those who refused to swear the oath of allegiance—the "refractory" or "non-juring" clergy—were immediately branded as enemies of the nation and liberty. They were seen as agents of superstition and foreign influence, actively working to undermine the Revolution from within, making them key targets during episodes of popular violence like the September Massacres.21
    
- Internal Political Opponents: The logic of purification was soon turned inward against revolutionaries themselves. The struggle for power between the more moderate Girondins and the radical Jacobin faction known as the Mountain saw the Jacobins deploy the same tactics of enemy-making against their rivals. The Girondins were accused of "federalism"—a desire to weaken the central authority of Paris—and were portrayed as secret allies of royalists and foreign enemies.16 Any call for moderation or restraint, especially during the height of the war crisis in 1793, was reframed as treason, making political dissent a capital crime.24
    

  

### The Abstract Enemy: Legislating Suspicion

  

The final and most terrifying stage in the evolution of the "enemy" was its abstraction. The target was no longer defined by a clear social status (noble) or a specific political act (refusing the oath), but by a vague and unprovable internal state. The Law of Suspects, passed on September 17, 1793, was the legal codification of this process.26 It institutionalized paranoia by creating an infinitely malleable definition of the enemy. "Suspects" were now those who, "by their conduct, associations, comments, or writings have shown themselves partisans of tyranny or federalism and enemies of liberty".26 This could include anyone from dismissed civil servants to former nobles and their families who had not "constantly demonstrated their devotion to the Revolution".26 In its most chilling formulation, the law targeted those who, while having "done nothing against freedom, also have done nothing for it".27 This criminalization of apathy and political neutrality meant that no one was safe. The enemy was no longer just the person who acted against the Revolution, but anyone who was not sufficiently enthusiastic in its support.

This evolution reveals a critical insight into the mechanics of revolutionary power. The category of "enemy" functioned as a "floating signifier"—a term whose meaning was deliberately kept vague so that it could be attached to any group or individual who threatened the power of the dominant faction at a given moment. The process began with tangible targets defined by class and privilege, which provided a clear and popular grievance. Once the utility of this enemy-making process was established, the definition was shifted to political affiliation to eliminate internal rivals. Finally, in its most radical phase, the definition became entirely abstract and behavioral. The crime was no longer what you were (a noble) or what you did (fled the country), but what you might think or what you had failed to do. This strategic abstraction made the Terror possible. By creating a category of "suspect" into which anyone could be placed, the revolutionary government fostered a pervasive climate of fear, enforced conformity, and gave itself a legal pretext for the elimination of any and all opposition.24

  

## Section III: The Revolutionary Megaphone: Communication Systems and Mobilization

  

The systematic dehumanization of enemies during the French Revolution could not have been effective without a powerful and extensive communication infrastructure capable of disseminating propaganda to a mass audience. The period saw the birth of a new media ecosystem and the development of a nationwide political network that together functioned as a revolutionary megaphone, translating the radical ideas forged in Paris into a national political force. The success of this mobilization lay not in mass media or grassroots organization alone, but in their powerful integration.

  

### The Proliferation of Print and the Culture of Collective Reading

  

The fall of the Bastille and the subsequent declaration of press freedom unleashed an unprecedented explosion in print media. Between July 1789 and 1790 alone, the number of newspapers in France mushroomed from a mere handful to over three hundred weekly and daily publications.30 By 1791, the total daily circulation of Parisian newspapers alone was estimated at 130,000 copies, a figure that would rise to 150,000 by 1797.30 This created a dynamic, highly politicized, and often chaotic information environment where competing factions vied for public opinion.

The impact of these circulation numbers was magnified exponentially by the prevailing culture of collective reading. In an era where literacy was far from universal, particularly among the working-class sans-culottes, the printed word reached its audience primarily through the spoken word.3 A single copy of a newspaper would be read aloud in public spaces—in the burgeoning coffee shops, in the halls of the political clubs, and on street corners—to groups of listeners. It is estimated that each individual newspaper was received by an average of ten adult readers, meaning that the 130,000 daily copies in 1791 could have reached well over a million people, a significant portion of the population.30 Newspapers were sold on the street by hawkers who would "sing" or shout the inflammatory headlines of the day, ensuring the key messages penetrated public consciousness.30 For the completely illiterate, the explosion in political caricature and satirical prints served as a vital alternative medium, conveying complex political arguments and mocking the ruling classes through vivid, easily understood imagery.3

  

### The Jacobin Network: A National Propaganda Machine

  

While the press provided the content, the Jacobin Club and its affiliates provided the national distribution and reinforcement network. Originating in 1789 as the Club Breton, a meeting group for anti-royalist deputies, the Jacobin movement grew into a formidable nationwide organization.7 By July 1790, there were already 152 affiliated clubs across France.31 At its peak in 1793, during the Reign of Terror, this network had expanded to an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 clubs, with a total membership of around half a million citizens.6

This network of clubs functioned as a highly efficient system for political mobilization and propaganda dissemination. The central club in Paris, dominated by figures like Robespierre, would debate issues and establish the political line. This line was then communicated to the hundreds of affiliated clubs in the provinces, which would in turn echo the rhetoric, enforce the decrees, and mobilize local support. During the Terror, these clubs became direct instruments of the revolutionary government, tasked with raising supplies for the army, policing local markets for hoarders, and leading the de-Christianization campaigns.31 Crucially, they were responsible for surveillance, drawing up lists of local "suspects" and watching over individuals whose opinions were deemed counter-revolutionary.27 This structure allowed the Jacobins to exert a remarkable degree of centralized control and ideological conformity across the vast and diverse territory of France.

  

### A Hybrid Model of Communication

  

The revolutionary mobilization was so effective because it created a hybrid communication model that fused the broad reach of centralized mass media with the intense, localized power of a grassroots network. Propaganda was not simply broadcast from Paris and passively received in the provinces. Instead, a pamphlet or newspaper article articulating a dehumanizing narrative would arrive from the capital and be introduced into the local Jacobin club. There, it would be read aloud, debated, and internalized among trusted peers. The abstract "enemy" described in a Parisian paper was given a local face, as the club members then applied these categories to their neighbors. This created a powerful feedback loop: the mass media provided the script, and the local clubs provided the stage, the actors, and the real-world enforcement. This hybrid system explains how the radicalism of Paris could be so effectively transmitted, amplified, and translated into concrete action—from political purges to violent repression—across the entire nation.

  

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Newspaper Title|Key Editor|Estimated Daily Circulation/Print Run|Estimated Social Reach (x10)|Notes on Distribution and Influence|
|L'Ami du Peuple|Jean-Paul Marat|~2,000 copies 17|~20,000|Small circulation but immense influence among key activists and sans-culottes. Relied on a secret network of distributors due to Marat's frequent persecution.17|
|Le Père Duchesne|Jacques-René Hébert|Several thousand; circulation figures are unclear but massively amplified by government purchases.35|Potentially hundreds of thousands during peak distribution.|Became the best-selling paper after Marat's death. The Ministry of War purchased thousands of copies to be distributed free to the armies to "animate their patriotism".36|
|Révolutions de France et de Brabant|Camille Desmoulins|N/A (specific figures not available)|N/A|Highly influential journalist, known for his eloquent style. His paper was a key voice in the early, radical phase of the revolution.|
|Annales patriotiques|Jean-Louis Carra & Louis-Sébastien Mercier|10,000–12,000 copies 30|100,000–120,000|One of the highest and most sustained print runs of the radical revolutionary papers, indicating a massive readership.|
|Journal du soir|Etienne Feuillant|10,000 copies in 1792 30|100,000|A key example of street-level distribution, with 180 paperboys "singing" the news on the streets of Paris at night.|

This data illustrates the scale and diversity of the revolutionary communication ecosystem. While some papers achieved massive commercial circulation, others like L'Ami du Peuple wielded influence far beyond their print numbers through targeted readership. Most significantly, the state itself became a major consumer and distributor of propaganda, as seen with Le Père Duchesne, demonstrating the fusion of media and government power to mobilize the nation for war and internal repression.

  

## Section IV: The Lexicon of Contempt: Dehumanization in the Radical Press

  

The radical newspapers of the Revolution were the primary engines for the creation and dissemination of a new political vocabulary—a lexicon of contempt designed to strip enemies of their humanity. The most influential of these journalists, Jacques-René Hébert and Jean-Paul Marat, developed distinct but complementary styles of dehumanization. Hébert's was visceral, profane, and scatological, appealing to the raw anger of the streets. Marat's was clinical, paranoid, and sanguinary, providing a pseudo-rational justification for extermination. Together, their work demonstrates the calculated use of language to transform political opponents into subhuman threats deserving of annihilation.

  

### 4.1. Hébert's Le Père Duchesne: The Politics of Profanity and Purgation

  

Jacques-René Hébert's newspaper, Le Père Duchesne, was a masterclass in populist propaganda. He achieved his immense popularity by adopting the persona of "Père Duchesne," a fictional, pipe-smoking, plain-speaking stove-maker who embodied the spirit of the Parisian sans-culottes.16 The paper's trademark was its "great anger" (

grande colère) and its relentless use of profane, gutter language.16 Hébert deliberately transcribed the speech of the common people, peppering his text with words like "foutre" (fuck) and "bougre" (bugger), which made his paper feel authentic, immediate, and deeply relatable to its working-class audience.5 This linguistic choice was a political act, proclaiming the legitimacy of the people's voice against the refined language of the elite.5

Hébert's primary dehumanizing strategy was rooted in concepts of filth and purification. His language was relentlessly scatological, framing enemies not as ideologically misguided but as literal pollution that contaminated the body politic.41 He referred to opponents as "human excrement," and the central theme of his work was the need to "purge" France of these "heterogeneous bodies".41 This rhetoric powerfully linked linguistic filth with the physical act of elimination, creating a visceral justification for violence. The guillotine, in this framing, was not just an instrument of justice but a tool of political hygiene.

This was complemented by a rich vocabulary of animalistic metaphors that cast enemies as parasites and vermin. In the pages of Le Père Duchesne, political opponents were "toads of the Marais" (a reference to the moderate deputies of the "Plain" or "Marsh" in the Convention), "bloodsuckers," "vampires," and "spiders".4 Foreign and domestic enemies were a menagerie of "predatory beasts," "dogs," "reptiles," "vermin," and "lice".4 This language is a classic example of blatant, animalistic dehumanization.12 It positions the enemy not as a human opponent with competing interests, but as a non-human pest or pathogen that must be eradicated for the health and survival of the nation.4

Furthermore, Hébert developed a chillingly casual slang for execution, which served to normalize and trivialize state-sanctioned killing. Being sent to the guillotine was described in euphemistic, almost playful terms. An enemy was to be taken by the "carriage with thirty-six doors" (the tumbril) to go "sneeze in the bag" (éternuer dans le sac), "ask the time from the fanlight" (demander l'heure au vasistas), or "try on Capet's necktie" (essayer la cravate à Capet).16 This linguistic trick diminished the horror of the act, lowering the psychological barrier for the public to accept, and even cheer for, the daily spectacle of mass executions.

  

### 4.2. Marat's L'Ami du Peuple: The Sanguinary Imperative

  

Where Hébert's rage was hot and explosive, Jean-Paul Marat's was cold and obsessive. In his hugely influential paper L'Ami du Peuple (The People's Friend), Marat's central theme was the existence of a vast, omnipresent conspiracy against the Revolution. He relentlessly portrayed France as being under constant siege from a shadowy network of "cruel enemies," "traitors," "vile and corrupted" members of the Assembly, and "henchmen of despotism".17 He stoked fear with apocalyptic warnings, predicting that if these enemies were to triumph for even a day, they would "overrun the provinces, fire and sword in hand, massacring the friends of the country, slaughtering women and children, and reducing our cities to ashes".17

Marat's proposed solution to this existential threat was consistently and brutally simple: preemptive extermination. His paper is infamous for its incessant calls for heads. He argued that violence was not only necessary but economically efficient. "Five or six hundred heads cut off," he famously wrote, "would have assured your repose, freedom and happiness".45 He lamented that a "false humanity has restrained your arm and suspended your blows; it will cost the lives of millions of your brothers".44 This rhetoric frames mass killing as a form of political hygiene, a grim but rational calculus. It is not wanton slaughter but a necessary surgical procedure to excise the cancer of counter-revolution before it can metastasize and destroy the nation.

Marat was also a master of dehumanization through othering, stripping his targets of their individual identities and reducing them to a single, hateful characteristic. His most famous tactic was his refusal to refer to Queen Marie Antoinette by her name or title, instead consistently labeling her "the Austrian woman" (l'Autrichienne).44 This relentlessly reinforced the idea of her as a foreigner, an outsider, and thus a natural enemy. After the flight to Varennes, he declared King Louis XVI a "vile perjurer" and a "cowardly deserter," proclaiming, "You are no longer my King... You are not even a citizen".19 He suggested the royal couple were fit only for the asylum at Charenton, effectively declaring them insane and outside the bounds of normal human society.19 In a particularly vicious passage, he imagined the people's enemies murdering patriots and their families, their "bloody hands" exploring "the entrails of your children to find their hearts".44 This graphic portrayal of the enemy as monstrous and sadistic served to strip them of any recognizable human quality, making their extermination seem like an act of self-defense against inhuman evil.44

The distinct styles of Hébert and Marat created a powerful synergy, functioning as two different but complementary engines for revolutionary violence. Hébert's profane, emotional, and scatological language provided the "hot," visceral rage. It was designed to provoke an immediate, passionate, and hateful response from the sans-culottes, tapping into their frustrations and mobilizing their raw anger. Marat's rhetoric, by contrast, was "cold" and pseudo-rational. He presented a clinical diagnosis of the nation's ills (conspiracy) and a clear, logical prescription (a specific number of beheadings). He framed mass violence not as an act of passion but as a calculated, preventative necessity. This combination was incredibly potent. It could simultaneously appeal to the gut-level fury of the street mob and to a sense of grim, rational duty. Hébert's hot rhetoric got the people into the streets, filled with rage; Marat's cold rhetoric gave that rage a specific target and a seemingly logical, even patriotic, purpose. It was a dual-pronged attack that justified both spontaneous riots and the organized, bureaucratic terror that was to come.

  

## Section V: The Virtue of Terror: Philosophical Dehumanization in Revolutionary Oratory

  

While the radical press stoked the fires of popular rage with visceral and profane language, the leaders of the Revolution, speaking from the formal rostrum of the National Convention, provided a "high" rhetorical framework that gave these impulses philosophical legitimacy. Maximilien Robespierre, the most powerful of these orators, was a master at translating the bloody demands of the street into the elevated, abstract language of political theory. His speeches performed the crucial function of laundering the base violence of the mob, repackaging it as a moral and political necessity for the educated, bourgeois deputies who constituted the revolutionary government. He made mass murder sound like an emanation of virtue.

  

### Robespierre's Framework: Virtue and Terror

  

Robespierre's political philosophy, heavily influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was built on a central dichotomy: virtue and terror. In his seminal speech "On the Principles of Political Morality" (February 5, 1794), he argued that the fundamental principle, or "mainspring," of a democratic government in peacetime is "virtue".9 He defined this virtue as "nothing other than the love of the nation and its laws," which in a republic translates to a love of equality.9 However, during a revolution, the nation is in a state of war—a "war of liberty against tyranny"—and virtue alone is insufficient.46 In such stormy circumstances, he declared, the mainspring of government must be "at the same time [both] virtue and terror: virtue, without which terror is fatal; terror, without which virtue is impotent".9

This formulation was a work of rhetorical genius. It preemptively refuted any accusation of arbitrary violence by inextricably linking terror to virtue. Terror, in his definition, was not the tool of a despot but was "nothing but prompt, severe, inflexible justice; it is therefore an emanation of virtue".9 He brilliantly inverted the charge of despotism: "The government of the revolution is the despotism of liberty against tyranny".9 By this logic, to oppose the Terror was to oppose virtue itself; to show mercy to the enemies of the Republic was not humane but a "parricidal gentleness" that would lead to the nation's destruction.46

  

### Defining the Enemy Out of Existence

  

Robespierre's most potent and sophisticated dehumanizing technique was not animalistic metaphor but conceptual expulsion. Through precise, legalistic-sounding definitions, he rhetorically ejected his opponents from the human and civic community, stripping them of any claim to rights or protection. He established a new, exclusive definition of citizenship: "Social protection is due only to peaceful citizens; there are no citizens in the Republic but the republicans".9 This single sentence is a masterstroke of political exclusion. It declares that anyone deemed not a "republican"—a term the Jacobins themselves defined—is not a citizen and is therefore owed no protection by the state.

He made this exclusion even more explicit by stating that "The royalists, the conspirators are, in its eyes, only strangers or, rather, enemies".9 The choice of the word "strangers" (

étrangers) is significant. It casts the internal enemy as an alien presence, a foreign body within the nation that must be expelled. They are not part of the "people" on whose behalf the Republic acts. This language effectively creates a separate, sub-citizen class to whom the normal rules of justice and morality do not apply.13

  

### The Enemy as an "Impure Race"

  

At times, Robespierre's abstract, political language veered into a more visceral, almost biological essentialism. He spoke of the need to combat an "impure race" of conspirators, rogues, and ambitious men who sought to corrupt public morals and divide the patriots.47 In a speech to the Jacobin Club, he warned, "As long as this impure race exists the Republic will be unhappy and precarious. It's up to you to deliver it by an imposing energy".47 This language moves beyond mere political disagreement. The term "impure race" suggests a fundamental, inherent, and perhaps even genetic corruption. It implies that the enemy is not simply someone who holds the wrong beliefs, but someone who

is fundamentally wrong, whose very existence is a contamination. This framing transforms a political purge into a form of ethnic or biological cleansing, providing a powerful justification for the physical extermination of the targeted group.

The contrast in style between Robespierre and the radical journalists was stark and was noted by their contemporaries. When the revolutionary Camille Desmoulins turned against the excesses of the Terror, he launched an attack on Hébert, pointedly stating, "I'm not going to attack you with vulgar insults," a clear jab at Hébert's trademark profanity.5 Robespierre rarely, if ever, stooped to such "low" language. He operated in the "high" register of philosophy, law, and morality.5 Yet, the political goal was identical. Hébert called for the purging of "filth" and "toads"; Robespierre called for the purging of those who lacked "virtue." Marat demanded the heads of "conspirators"; Robespierre argued that terror against the "people's enemies" was an "emanation of virtue."

This reveals Robespierre's crucial role in the revolutionary process. His oratory provided the intellectual and moral justification that allowed the revolutionary government to adopt the policies of the street mob as official state policy. He took the visceral hatred articulated by Hébert and the bloody calculus of Marat and laundered them through the sophisticated language of Enlightenment philosophy. For the educated lawyers and bourgeois professionals who sat in the National Convention, this was a necessary step. They might have been repulsed by the gutter profanity of Le Père Duchesne, but they could be persuaded by an argument framed in the noble concepts of virtue, justice, and the general will. Robespierre provided the essential political bridge between the street and the state, making the Terror intellectually and morally palatable to the men who would legislate it into existence.

  

## Section VI: The Dehumanized Image: Visual Propaganda and the Illiterate Masses

  

In a society where a significant portion of the population was illiterate, visual propaganda was not merely supplementary but essential to the revolutionary project.3 The explosion of printmaking produced a torrent of political cartoons, engravings, and broadsides that communicated complex political ideas and visceral hatreds to a mass audience. These images functioned as a powerful tool of dehumanization, operating on a spectrum of increasing aggression that mirrored the radicalization of the Revolution itself. They moved from explaining grievances, to vilifying individuals, to symbolically annihilating the enemy, paving the way for physical violence.

  

### 6.1. Allegories of Oppression: The Parasitic Old Order

  

In the early phase of the Revolution, prints often used simple, powerful allegories to explain the political and economic injustices of the Ancien Régime. The most iconic and widely circulated of these images depicted a peasant, symbolizing the Third Estate, bent double under the weight of a clergyman and a nobleman riding on his back.18 Captions such as "It won't last forever" (

Ça n'durra pas toujours) or "One must hope that this game will soon be over" (A faut esperer q'eu se jeu la finira ben tot) made the message unambiguous: the First and Second Estates were parasitic burdens on the productive body of the nation.49 These images were primarily didactic; their goal was to educate the public about the nature of their oppression. The figures were symbolic but still recognizably human. A popular variant of this print, produced after the initial revolutionary victories, showed the tables turned: the triumphant peasant, now armed and upright, rides gleefully on the backs of the humbled priest and aristocrat, signifying the dramatic reversal of the social order.50

  

### 6.2. The Bestiary of the Revolution: Animalistic and Monstrous Caricatures

  

As the Revolution radicalized, particularly after the king's flight to Varennes, the visual language shifted from explanation to outright vilification. Animalistic and monstrous imagery became commonplace, a blatant form of dehumanization designed to strip the enemy of human dignity and evoke primal emotions of disgust and fear.

- The Royal Family: The king and queen were the primary targets of this visual assault. Louis XVI, once the sacred father of the nation, was relentlessly depicted as a pig.52 This choice of animal was rich with negative connotations: greed, filth, gluttony, and, through the association with the castrated boar, impotence—a direct reference to the long-standing rumors about the king's inability to produce an heir.52 One anonymous print from 1791, "Louis Rides a Pig," shows the king being carried by the animal, symbolizing his base nature.49 Another shows the entire royal family as a "family of pigs" being herded back into their sty after their capture at Varennes.52 Beyond simple animalization, the royal couple was also depicted as a freak of nature. A 1791 engraving titled "Les Deux ne font qu'un" (The Two are but One) portrays the king and queen as a grotesque, two-headed monster, visually representing them as unnatural and fundamentally alien.20
    
- The Aristocracy and Clergy: This tactic was extended to the broader privileged orders. While royalist caricatures sometimes used animals like cranes to represent treacherous aristocrats such as Lafayette 52, revolutionary prints employed a wider bestiary to mock their enemies. One satirical print, "Assemblée des nouveaux francs-maçons," depicts a secret meeting where the prosecutor is a wolf, the treasurer a porcupine, and the speaker a parrot, reducing political roles to animalistic traits.52
    
- The Revolution as Monster: This weapon of visual dehumanization was, of course, a double-edged sword. Counter-revolutionary propaganda, especially from Britain, eagerly adopted the same tactics. A 1798 British cartoon by William Brown portrays the French Republic itself as "The Great monster, Republican," a demonic, multi-headed beast with one foot on Switzerland, threatening to plant its "tree of liberty" in Britain.53 Another earlier print by Isaac Cruikshank depicted Napoleon as a grotesque "French Bugabo," a monstrous bogeyman.56
    

  

### 6.3. Grotesque Realism: Humiliation through the Body

  

The most aggressive form of visual propaganda drew on a long European tradition of carnivalesque and grotesque humor, which uses the body—its functions, its fluids, its vulnerability—to degrade and humiliate figures of authority.57 This "grotesque realism" was a form of symbolic violence that prefigured and normalized the physical violence of the Terror.58

- Scatological Imagery: The use of excrement was a powerful tool for expressing ultimate contempt. In a direct visual assault on the authority of the Papacy, a 1791 caricature showed a patriot named "Jacques Bonhomme" wiping his backside with a papal bull that condemned the Civil Constitution of the Clergy.59 This act of scatological desecration symbolically reduced the highest spiritual authority to worthless filth. This tradition was famously continued by Honoré Daumier in the 19th century, whose caricature of King Louis-Philippe as the Rabelaisian giant Gargantua, sitting on a toilet and defecating honors and positions onto his sycophantic supporters, perfectly illustrates the use of the grotesque body to signify political corruption.58
    
- Grotesque Distortion: Caricaturists used physical distortion to mark enemies as alien and inhuman. A 1792 print, "Procession of Refractory Clergy," depicts the non-juring priests with grotesquely long noses, a feature traditionally used in anti-Semitic caricatures to signify otherness and malevolence.22 This visual cue subtly suggested to the viewer that these priests were not truly part of the French "people." The procession is followed by a menacing satyr holding a coffin, an explicit threat against their lives.22 The severing of the head in prints was the ultimate visual metaphor for dehumanization, as it removed the rational part of the body and the chief means of identification, reducing the authority figure to a mere object.58
    

This progression in visual language—from didactic allegory, to vilifying animalization, to symbolic annihilation through the grotesque—demonstrates a calculated escalation. The visual rhetoric grew more violent and more dehumanizing in lockstep with the political radicalization of the Revolution. It moved from a critique of an unjust system to a visceral attack on the nature of its representatives, preparing the public mind for their eventual physical destruction.

  

## Section VII: From Word to Deed: The Institutionalization of Dehumanization

  

The dehumanizing language of the press and the grotesque imagery of the caricaturists were not merely abstract expressions of hatred. They were foundational elements in a process that translated rhetoric directly into state policy and institutionalized violence. The period of the Reign of Terror represents the culmination of this process, where the "enemy of the people," having been defined and dehumanized in the public sphere, was systematically targeted for elimination by the machinery of the state. This transition from stochastic, mob-led violence to organized, bureaucratic terror was made possible by legal instruments that codified paranoia and by state-sanctioned rituals that industrialized killing.

  

### 7.1. The Law of Suspects: Codifying Paranoia

  

The Law of Suspects, decreed by the National Convention on September 17, 1793, stands as the legal embodiment of the dehumanizing worldview propagated by the radicals.26 This single piece of legislation effectively suspended normal legal protections and authorized the creation of revolutionary tribunals to arrest and punish anyone suspected of treason.24 It marked a significant weakening of individual freedoms and unleashed what some historians have termed a "revolutionary paranoia" that swept the nation.27

The law's power lay in its deliberately vague and all-encompassing definitions of a "suspect." The net was cast wide enough to catch not only avowed enemies but anyone whose revolutionary zeal was deemed insufficient. Suspects included:

- Those who "by their conduct, associations, comments, or writings have shown themselves partisans of tyranny or federalism and enemies of liberty".26
    
- Those unable to justify their means of existence or prove their performance of "civic duties".27
    
- Former nobles and their families who had not "constantly demonstrated their devotion to the Revolution".26
    
- Anyone to whom a "certificate of patriotism" had been refused.27
    

This law transformed the justice system into an "enforcement arm of the revolutionary government".26 The burden of proof was effectively reversed: citizens were guilty until they could prove their revolutionary purity. The result was a wave of arrests that engulfed France. Estimates vary, but well over 200,000, and perhaps as many as 500,000, citizens were arrested under the law.27 While many were never formally tried, they languished in disease-ridden prisons where thousands perished.27 The law was the essential legal mechanism that enabled the Terror, providing a veneer of legality for the mass imprisonment and execution of those who had been rhetorically cast out of the national community.

  

### 7.2. Case Study: The September Massacres (1792)

  

The September Massacres of 1792 serve as a chilling case study of how dehumanizing propaganda could erupt into mass violence even before the Terror was officially institutionalized as state policy. In late August and early September, with the Prussian army advancing on Paris, a mood of panic and hysteria gripped the capital.21 This fear was stoked by radical journalists like Marat, who spread rumors of a "prison conspiracy"—a plot in which counter-revolutionary prisoners (especially refractory priests and aristocrats) would break out, slaughter the patriots' families, and hand the city over to the Prussians.21

Inflamed by this propaganda, crowds of armed citizens, composed largely of Parisian National Guardsmen (sans-culottes) and provincial volunteers (fédérés), stormed the city's prisons.21 Over four days, they enacted what they saw as "popular justice," setting up hasty "popular tribunals" before dragging the prisoners out and slaughtering them with pikes, swords, and clubs.61 Between 1,100 and 1,400 people were killed.61

The language of the perpetrators and their supporters, captured in eyewitness accounts and letters, directly mirrors the dehumanizing rhetoric of the press. One Montagnard deputy, Pierre Dubreuil-Chambardel, wrote approvingly of the events: "The entire scoundrel race of the non-juring [priests] is meeting the fate that all their crimes deserve. There is reason to believe that the empire will soon be purged of all these monsters".65 The killers were known as

septembriseurs, and their actions were framed as a necessary act of national purification. The Minister of Justice, Georges Danton, when implored to stop the slaughter, gave a response that perfectly captured the official sanction of the violence: "When the people have exerted their rights, I will resume mine".66 He framed the massacre not as a criminal atrocity but as a legitimate, if terrible, expression of popular sovereignty.

  

### 7.3. The Guillotine: Ritualized Purgation as Public Spectacle

  

The Reign of Terror represents the successful state co-option and systematization of the kind of popular violence seen in the September Massacres. The Jacobin government did not invent this violence; it harnessed, legitimized, and industrialized it. The primary instrument and symbol of this new, bureaucratic terror was the guillotine.

The guillotine held a powerful and paradoxical symbolism. On one hand, it was hailed as the "Republican Razor," a great leveler and a symbol of Enlightenment equality.67 Conceived as a more humane method of execution, its key feature was that it was applied to all citizens equally, regardless of class.11 Whereas under the

Ancien Régime nobles were beheaded by sword and commoners were hanged, the guillotine offered the same swift, clean death to everyone, from King Louis XVI to the humblest peasant.67 Supporters celebrated it with affectionate nicknames like the "people's axe," the "national hatchet," and, most tellingly, "the scythe of equality".67

On the other hand, the guillotine quickly became the ultimate symbol of the Terror's oppressive violence.70 Executions were transformed into highly ritualized public spectacles.67 Huge crowds gathered daily in the Place de la Révolution (now the Place de la Concorde) to witness the killings, which were treated as a form of popular entertainment.11 Vendors sold programs listing the names of the condemned, and the public's reaction to the victim's behavior on the scaffold was a key part of the drama.11 This ritual transformed state-sanctioned killing into a participatory political theater, reinforcing the power of the state and the exclusion of its enemies.

The physical act of decapitation was itself a potent symbol of dehumanization. It violently severed the head—the seat of reason and identity—from the body, rendering the victim an anonymous, fragmented corpse.58 The guillotine was, in a sense, an image-making machine, producing severed heads that were sometimes displayed to the crowd or rendered in prints and wax models, blurring the line between the violent event and its representation.73 The power of this ritual was most vividly demonstrated in its subversion. When the sixteen Carmelite nuns of Compiègne were executed in July 1794, they went to their deaths singing hymns. Their display of faith and dignity created a powerful counter-ritual that, according to onlookers, stunned the usually cheering crowd into an awed silence, broken only by the sound of their singing and the fall of the blade.74

The path from the September Massacres to the daily operations of the guillotine reveals a clear political logic. The revolutionary government, having seen both the utility and the danger of uncontrolled mob violence, moved to bring that energy under state control. They created the legal framework (The Law of Suspects) to define who could be killed and the institutional machinery (The Revolutionary Tribunal, The Committee of Public Safety) to process them.10 Finally, they created a state-sanctioned ritual—the public execution—that replaced the chaotic, unpredictable violence of the massacre with an orderly, bureaucratic, and daily process of elimination. The state effectively told the people, "Your impulse to purge the nation of its enemies is correct, but let us do it for you, more efficiently, and with the full authority of the law."

  

## Section VIII: Contemporary Criticism and the Aftermath

  

The campaign of dehumanization and the resulting violence of the Terror were not universally accepted, even within the revolutionary camp. The methods were contested at the time, sparking criticism from fellow radicals in France and provoking a powerful wave of anti-Jacobin sentiment abroad. This contemporary debate reveals a fundamental and enduring political conflict over whether noble ends can ever justify dehumanizing means, a conflict that defined the Revolution's later stages and has shaped its legacy ever since.

  

### Internal Criticism: The Clash Between Desmoulins and Hébert

  

One of the most significant internal critiques of the Terror's dehumanizing rhetoric came from Camille Desmoulins, an influential journalist and a leading Jacobin who had been a key figure since the storming of the Bastille. In late 1793, as the Terror accelerated, Desmoulins launched a new newspaper, Le Vieux Cordelier, in which he called for moderation and an end to the ceaseless purges. He directly targeted Jacques-René Hébert and the profane, extremist style of Le Père Duchesne. In a pointed attack, Desmoulins declared, "I'm not going to attack you with vulgar insults," explicitly rejecting Hébert's gutter-level language as a legitimate tool of revolutionary discourse.5

This clash was not a conflict between a revolutionary and a royalist; it was a struggle within the heart of the radical movement itself over the character and methods of the Revolution. Desmoulins and his ally, Georges Danton, represented a faction that believed the Republic was secure enough to relax the Terror and that the constant dehumanization and bloodletting were alienating the populace and destroying the soul of the Revolution. Hébert, backed by the most radical sans-culottes, argued for ever more extreme measures. Robespierre, caught between these factions, ultimately sided against both, sending first the Hébertists and then the Dantonists, including Desmoulins, to the guillotine in the spring of 1794. This episode demonstrates that the use of extreme dehumanizing language was a conscious and controversial political choice, not an inevitable or unconscious expression of revolutionary passion.

  

### External Criticism and the Rise of Anti-Jacobinism

  

Outside of France, the rhetoric of the Jacobins and the violence of the Terror provoked a powerful conservative backlash, particularly in Britain and the United States.75 "Anti-Jacobinism" became a potent political ideology, used to condemn not only the French Revolution but also domestic reform movements. British conservative writers and caricaturists, like Edmund Burke and James Gillray, seized upon the violence to portray the entire revolutionary project as a descent into blood-soaked anarchy.56 They turned the revolutionaries' own tactics against them, depicting the Jacobins and the sans-culottes as grotesque monsters, cannibals, and bloodthirsty fanatics, thus dehumanizing the dehumanizers.75

In the newly formed United States, the French Revolution created deep political divisions. The Federalist party, led by figures like John Adams, used the "Reign of Terror" as a powerful cautionary tale. They deployed "nightmarishly vivid" and violent rhetoric to warn that their own young republic could descend into similar chaos if the pro-French, "Jacobin" ideas of Thomas Jefferson and his Democratic-Republicans were allowed to prevail.75 This anti-Jacobin rhetoric painted American republicanism as a "pacific middle road between the brutality of monarchy and the savagery of democracy," effectively using the excesses of the French Revolution to police the boundaries of acceptable political discourse at home.76

  

### The Enduring Pejorative of "Jacobinism"

  

In the aftermath of the Revolution, and for centuries to come, the term "Jacobin" became detached from its specific historical context and was transformed into a powerful political pejorative.7 In the mouths of conservatives, "Jacobinism" became a synonym for violent extremism, mob rule, and terror.7 Even among some progressives, the term was used to denote the violent excesses of the Revolution, which they contrasted with the supposedly more principled and humane ideals of the Girondins.7 This historical memory, often shaped by the success of anti-Jacobin propaganda, has tended to eclipse the Jacobins' more democratic and egalitarian goals, such as their implementation of universal male suffrage and the abolition of feudalism.7

The contemporary criticism of Jacobin rhetoric highlights a fundamental political and moral dilemma that was being fought out in real time. The conflict between Desmoulins and Hébert, and between the Jacobins and their foreign critics, was ultimately a debate over means and ends. Robespierre and his allies explicitly argued that their ends—the establishment of a virtuous Republic—justified their means—the "despotism of liberty against tyranny".9 Their critics, both internal and external, argued that the dehumanizing and violent means had corrupted the revolutionary ends, transforming a movement for liberty into a machine of oppression. This tension between the pursuit of revolutionary ideals and the protection of basic human rights and dignities was not resolved in the 1790s. It became a central and tragic theme of modern political history, as subsequent revolutionary movements grappled with the terrible precedent set during the French Revolution's Reign of Terror.29

  

## Conclusion: The Terrible Legacy: Dehumanization as a Modern Political Template

  

The analysis presented in this report demonstrates that the dehumanization of enemies during the French Revolution was not an ancillary feature of the conflict but a core component of its organizational and mobilization strategy. It was a deliberate, systematic, and multi-platform campaign that was instrumental in achieving the key objectives of the radical phase of the Revolution: destroying the moral and political legitimacy of the Ancien Régime, mobilizing a mass base for radical action, providing a justification for the purging of internal political rivals, and consolidating the power of a determined minority in the face of overwhelming internal and external threats.

The Revolution's leaders and propagandists did not invent the concept of dehumanization, but they perfected its use as a tool of modern, secular mass politics. They fused several critical elements into a powerful and terrifyingly replicable template for political violence:

1. A Totalizing, Manichaean Ideology: Revolutionary thought, particularly in its Jacobin expression, divided the world into a stark binary of absolute good and absolute evil. On one side were the "people," the "patriots," and the defenders of "virtue"; on the other were the "enemies of the people," the "conspirators," and the agents of "tyranny".9 There was no middle ground; as Robespierre made clear, those who were not actively for the Republic were against it. This worldview created the necessary precondition for dehumanization by framing political disagreement as an existential battle between purity and corruption.
    
2. The Power of Mass Media: The Revolution harnessed the new power of mass media to disseminate this ideology and its accompanying dehumanizing rhetoric. The radical press and an explosion of political imagery saturated the public sphere with narratives that portrayed enemies as parasites, vermin, filth, monsters, and traitors who deserved to be purged from the body politic.4 This constant drumbeat of contempt normalized what was once unthinkable and prepared the public mind for violence.
    
3. The Bureaucratization of Elimination: The final, crucial element was the creation of a legal and bureaucratic apparatus to carry out the physical elimination of the dehumanized groups. The Law of Suspects provided the legal pretext, the Committee of Public Safety provided the executive will, and the Revolutionary Tribunal provided the judicial process.10 The guillotine, in turn, provided the efficient, industrial means of execution. This transformed the chaotic violence of the mob into the systematic, state-sanctioned violence of the Terror.
    

This template—the fusion of a totalizing ideology, the use of mass media to spread dehumanizing propaganda, and the creation of a bureaucratic state apparatus for extermination—has cast a long and dark shadow over modern history. The language of "purity" and "purgation," the identification of entire groups as "enemies of the people" or subhuman "vermin," and the justification of extreme violence in the name of a higher historical or national purpose would be echoed in the rhetoric of subsequent totalitarian regimes, wars, and genocides.4 The French Revolution, in its fervent and violent attempt to create a new, virtuous citizen, also provided a chillingly effective and enduring blueprint for how to define, dehumanize, and destroy those deemed unworthy of belonging to the new world being born. Its legacy is a stark reminder that the language used to define an enemy is one of the most powerful and dangerous political weapons ever devised.
