# The Voice of Audacity: An Analysis of the Oratory and Impact of Georges Danton

  ![[Danton's Double-Edged Sword_ Audacity, Massacres, and the French Revolution's Roaring Voice.mp3]]
  

## Introduction: The Tribune of the People

  

Georges-Jacques Danton stands as a singular figure in the pantheon of French Revolutionary orators. He was not a polished writer like Camille Desmoulins, nor a meticulous ideologue like Maximilien Robespierre. Instead, Danton was a force of nature, a political phenomenon whose power was inseparable from his physical presence and the volcanic context of the Revolution itself.1 His most potent contributions were not written reports but explosive, improvised speeches that served as both a mirror and a motor for the Revolution's most critical and violent moments. His calls for audacity were the ultimate expression of a political strategy that embraced chaos to forge a new nation.

Danton’s physical bearing was a key component of his rhetorical authority. Contemporaries described a man of "Herculean proportions" with a "massive head" and a pockmarked face he himself called his "Medusa head" that made aristocrats tremble.3 This imposing figure possessed a "sonorous voice" and employed "impetuous gesticulation" to command attention.3 Unlike his rivals, who carefully prepared academic disputations and read them from the tribune, Danton always spoke extemporaneously.4 His words were not recited; they erupted, pouring forth in "mighty billows" that seemed to draw their energy directly from the crisis of the moment and the passions of his audience.5 This raw, improvisational style established his persona as a "man of action," not a theorist—a self-made man who viewed speeches as deeds, designed for immediate, tangible results.4

This approach forged an unparalleled bond with the Parisian working class, the sans-culottes. While his opponents rebuked him for what they considered "coarse, cynical, and vulgar speech," this was the very idiom that resonated with the street, making him their true tribune.4 His oratorical power stemmed from a symbiotic feedback loop with the revolutionary crowd; his visceral style both channeled and amplified popular passions, making him the indispensable leader in moments of acute crisis. It was a power contingent on the very chaos he so masterfully commanded. Any analysis of his speeches is therefore a study of these live, interactive events, reconstructed from journalistic accounts in publications like

Le Moniteur, as Danton himself, disdainful of posterity, never prepared manuscripts.6

## Part I: "To Conquer, We Must Dare" – The Speeches of September 1792

  
  

### 1.1 The Fatherland in Danger: The Crucible of Late Summer 1792

  

The orations for which Georges Danton is most remembered were forged in the crucible of late summer 1792, a period of existential crisis for the French Revolution. Following the declaration of war against Austria in April, France found itself facing a formidable coalition that soon included Prussia.4 The French army was in disarray, and by late August, the allied forces under the command of the Duke of Brunswick had crossed the frontier, capturing the fortress of Longwy.17 The news that the critical city of Verdun was under siege sent a wave of panic through Paris.10 This military terror was amplified by a political one: the Brunswick Manifesto. Issued in July, it threatened Paris with "military execution and a total subversion" if any harm befell the royal family, an ultimatum that inflamed republican sentiment and fueled a deep-seated paranoia about traitors and internal enemies.11

In this superheated atmosphere, political power in Paris had shifted decisively. The insurrection of August 10, 1792, had overthrown the monarchy, and effective control of the capital rested with the new, radical Paris Commune.18 As the newly appointed Minister of Justice, Danton was a commanding figure in this provisional government, his influence amplified by his history as a leader of the Cordeliers Club and his connection to the popular movement.1 The government's primary concern became defense, but this concern was twofold: against the enemy at the gates, and the perceived enemy within. The imminent departure of thousands of volunteers to the front lines gave rise to a pervasive fear that the city's overflowing prisons, filled with political suspects, royalists, and non-juring priests, would become the source of a counter-revolutionary uprising.17 Acting on this fear, the Commune, at Danton's behest, had authorized house-to-house searches that added more than a thousand new "suspects" to the already crowded jails, setting the stage for a violent explosion.18

  

### 1.2 The Speech of September 2, 1792: "De l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace!"

  

It was in this moment of supreme crisis, at approximately 1:00 PM on September 2, that Danton ascended the tribune of the Legislative Assembly. He delivered an address that would become the most famous of his career, a masterpiece of crisis oratory that perfectly encapsulated his political genius.

  

#### Full Text of the Speech

  

Il est satisfaisant pour les ministres d'un peuple libre, d'avoir à lui annoncer que la patrie va être sauvée. Tout s'émeut, tout s'ébranle, tout brûle de combattre. Vous savez que Verdun n'est point encore au pouvoir de nos ennemis. Vous savez que la garnison a promis d'immoler le premier qui proposerait de se rendre. Une partie du peuple va se porter aux frontières, une autre va creuser des retranchements, et la troisième, avec des piques, défendra l'intérieur de nos villes. Paris va seconder ces grands efforts. Les commissaires de la Commune vont proclamer, d'une manière solennelle, l'invitation aux citoyens de s'armer et de marcher pour la défense de la patrie. C'est en ce moment, messieurs, que vous pouvez déclarer que la capitale a bien mérité de la France entière. C'est en ce moment que l'Assemblée nationale va devenir un véritable comité de guerre. Nous demandons que vous concouriez avec nous à diriger ce mouvement sublime du peuple, en nommant des commissaires qui nous seconderont dans ces grandes mesures. Nous demandons que quiconque refusera de servir de sa personne, ou de remettre ses armes, sera puni de mort. Nous demandons qu'il soit fait une instruction aux citoyens pour diriger leurs mouvements. Nous demandons qu'il soit envoyé des courriers dans tous les départements pour avertir des décrets que vous aurez rendus. Le tocsin qu'on va sonner n'est point un signal d'alarme, c'est la charge sur les ennemis de la patrie. Pour les vaincre, messieurs, il nous faut de l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace, et la France est sauvée. 11

It is gratifying to the ministers of a free people to have to announce to them that their country will be saved. All are stirred, all are excited, all burn to fight. You know that Verdun is not yet in the power of our enemies. You know that its garrison swears to immolate the first who breathes a proposition of surrender. One portion of our people will proceed to the frontiers, another will throw up entrenchments, and the third with pikes will defend the hearts of our cities. Paris will second these great efforts. The commissioners of the Commune will solemnly proclaim to the citizens the invitation to arm and march to the defense of the country. At such a moment you can proclaim that the capital deserves well of all France. At such a moment this National Assembly becomes a veritable committee of war. We ask that you concur with us in directing this sublime movement of the people, by naming commissioners who will second us in these great measures. We ask that anyone refusing to give personal service or to furnish arms shall be punished with death. We ask that a set of instructions be drawn up for the citizens to direct their movements. We ask that couriers be sent to all the departments to notify them of the decrees that you proclaim here. The tocsin we are about to ring is not an alarm signal; it sounds the charge on the enemies of our country. To conquer them we must dare, dare again, always dare, and France is saved! 10

  

#### Rhetorical Analysis

  

The speech is a model of efficiency and power. It is short, direct, and relentlessly action-oriented. Its structure is a rapid escalation from a declaration of patriotic fervor ("tout brûle de combattre") to a series of concrete, ruthless demands: commissioners to direct the popular movement, instructions for the citizens, and, most chillingly, the death penalty for anyone refusing to serve or surrender their arms.2 This establishes the life-or-death stakes of the moment.

Danton’s mastery of pathos is on full display. He skillfully reframes the sound of the tocsin—the traditional bell of alarm and danger—into a symbol of aggression and empowerment. It is "not an alarm signal," he thunders, but "the charge on the enemies of our country".7 This brilliant rhetorical pivot was designed to transform the prevailing emotion of panic into martial fury. Speaking with the full authority of the Minister of Justice, he effectively commandeers the legislature, declaring it a "veritable committee of war" and demanding its concurrence with the Commune's measures, thus asserting his own executive leadership.7 The speech culminates in its immortal climax, the tripartite call for audacity, a phrase that would echo through French history.

  

### 1.3 The Echo of the Tocsin: Audience Reaction and Immediate Impact

  

The effect of Danton's oration was immediate and profound. The Legislative Assembly, swept up in the patriotic energy, met his words with applause and moved quickly to enact his proposals.2 Decrees were passed that mirrored the demands made in the speech, including the harsh punishment for those who failed to contribute to the war effort.10 The "Loi du 2 septembre 1792" stands as a direct legislative consequence of Danton's words.23

Beyond the chamber, the speech acted as a powerful "call for direct action among the citizens".2 As the tocsin rang out across Paris, the city responded. Thousands of volunteers flocked to recruitment stations set up on the Champ de Mars and other public squares, enlisting to defend the nation.7 The speech was a remarkable catalyst for military mobilization, turning the tide of recruitment at a moment of supreme national danger.24 This patriotic surge would culminate just over two weeks later in the crucial victory at Valmy, which checked the Prussian advance and saved the Revolution.10

  

### 1.4 The Shadow of the Massacres: Audacity's Terrible Corollary

  

The call for audacity had a second, more terrible echo. On the very afternoon that Danton spoke and volunteers enlisted, the September Massacres began.17 For four days, frenzied mobs of

sans-culottes and guardsmen stormed the prisons of Paris—the Abbaye, the Conciergerie, the Salpêtrière—and summarily executed their inmates. Between 1,100 and 1,600 people were slaughtered, including non-juring priests, aristocrats, political prisoners, and a large number of common criminals who were simply caught in the maelstrom.2

Contemporaries, particularly Danton's Girondin rival Madame Roland, held him directly responsible, arguing that his incendiary speech had deliberately incited the killings.2 An account from one witness, Grandpré, who pleaded with Danton to intervene, reported that the Minister of Justice shouted, "I don't give a damn for the prisoners they can go to the devil".28 While there is no definitive proof that Danton or any single individual organized the massacres, it is certain that as the head of the justice system, he did nothing to stop them.17 Historians often attribute the violence to a "collective mentality" of fear and revenge that gripped the city.18

Danton's inaction was a grimly pragmatic political calculation. To stop the massacres would have required confronting the Parisian mobs, the very foundation of his political power. It would have been politically, and perhaps physically, suicidal.13 He chose to ride the wave of popular fury rather than be crushed by it. His speech, therefore, performed a terrifying dual function. The abstract call for "audacity" was a work of rhetorical alchemy, deliberately ambiguous enough to be interpreted in multiple ways. For a soldier heading to the front, it meant courage. For a legislator, it meant passing draconian laws. For a panicked citizen convinced that traitors were plotting in the prisons, it was a license to take direct, murderous action. The speech did not cause the massacres, but it provided the moral justification, unleashing a popular energy that manifested as both heroic military mobilization and brutal mob violence.

  

## Part II: The Instruments of Revolution: Speeches on Governance and Terror

  

As the Revolution moved beyond the immediate crisis of 1792, Danton’s oratory evolved. He shifted from rousing the streets to attempting to forge the permanent institutions of the new Republic. His speeches from this period reveal a pragmatic, if ruthless, state-builder trying to channel the raw, chaotic energy of the popular revolution into stable, state-controlled structures.

  

### 2.1 "Let Us Be Terrible": The Creation of the Revolutionary Tribunal (March 1793)

  

By the spring of 1793, France was once again in peril. Military defeats and the shocking treason of General Dumouriez, who defected to the Austrians, fueled a new wave of paranoia and calls for vengeance against internal enemies.13 Fearing a repeat of the anarchic violence of the previous September, Danton took to the tribune of the National Convention on March 10, 1793, to propose a radical solution: institutionalized terror.

In a speech justifying the creation of an extraordinary criminal court, he laid out his stark logic. "The salvation of the people requires great means and terrible measures," he argued. His core justification was a direct response to the memory of the September Massacres: "Let us be terrible to prevent the people from being so" ("Soyons terribles pour dispenser le peuple de l'être").13 He contended that a state-sanctioned tribunal, empowered to act swiftly against counter-revolutionaries, was the only humane alternative to the spontaneous, uncontrollable slaughter of mob justice. The Convention was convinced, and the Revolutionary Tribunal was established.13 This act marked a pivotal moment, as the Revolution began to formalize the legal machinery of the Reign of Terror. In a turn of profound historical irony, it was this very institution that would send Danton himself to the guillotine just one year later, a fate he grimly acknowledged during his own trial.31

  

### 2.2 Forging a Nation: Speeches on Unity and Republican Education

  

Alongside creating instruments of terror, Danton used his oratorical power for more constructive, nation-building purposes. Facing the threat of federalist movements from the Girondins, which he feared would lead to civil war and the fragmentation of France, he delivered powerful speeches championing national unity. He successfully proposed the death penalty for anyone advocating the dismemberment of the country, leading to the landmark decree that "the French Republic is one and indivisible".7

Danton also saw public education as a cornerstone of the new state. In speeches delivered in August and December 1793, he articulated a radical vision for a national, secular education system designed to create a new generation of republican citizens.4 "After bread, education is the first need of the people," he declared, arguing that the children of the poor should be educated at the expense of the wealthy.15 He went further, proclaiming that "children belong to the Republic before belonging to their parents" and must "suckle republican milk" in national schools to ensure their loyalty to the state over familial or local interests.15 These speeches on the Tribunal and on education, though seemingly disparate, were two sides of the same state-building project. One was a short-term, surgical tool to eliminate enemies; the other was a long-term, preventative measure to cultivate loyal citizens. Both represented a massive expansion of state power, revealing Danton not just as a populist tribune, but as a governor attempting to build a durable state that could contain and direct the revolutionary passions he had once unleashed.

  

## Part III: The Revolution Devours Its Children: The Final Orations

  

By the end of 1793, the revolutionary tide had turned against Danton. The man whose voice had once summoned the furies of the Revolution now found himself trying to quell them. His final orations chronicle a tragic downfall, where his greatest weapon—his voice—became his last and ultimately futile line of defense against the very terror he had helped institutionalize.

  

### 3.1 The Call for Clemency: The Indulgent's Gambit

  

As the Reign of Terror reached its zenith in late 1793, Danton returned to the political stage after a brief retreat to his country home.2 He emerged as the leader of a moderate faction known as the

Indulgents, who argued that with the immediate military crisis abating, it was time to relax the Terror, establish a "Committee of Clemency," and seek a negotiated peace with foreign powers.17 His rhetoric underwent a complete reversal. The orator who had demanded the death penalty for shirkers now attacked the excesses of religious persecution and called for a "frugality with human lives".2

This political shift set him on a fatal collision course with Robespierre and the powerful Committee of Public Safety. The conflict was not merely political but deeply ideological. To Robespierre and his austere lieutenant, Saint-Just, the call for moderation was not a sign of humanity but of moral weakness and a lack of revolutionary "virtue".16 Danton's well-known epicurean lifestyle, his pursuit of pleasure, and the persistent, though unproven, accusations of financial corruption were marshaled against him as evidence that he was no longer a true revolutionary.13 The chasm between Robespierre's "Incorruptible" Puritanism and Danton's pragmatic, life-affirming indulgence became an unbridgeable political divide.

  

### 3.2 The Final Defense: Oratory as a Weapon Against the Inevitable (April 1794)

  

In late March 1794, the inevitable occurred. Danton, Desmoulins, and their allies were arrested and brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal. The charges were a vague amalgam of conspiracy with royalists and financial malfeasance.2 Danton refused to go quietly. He transformed his trial into a final, defiant oratorical performance, his last stand on a public stage. He spoke with such boldness and power that he began to sway the crowd and unnerve the judges.8 He bellowed his innocence and his service to the Revolution: "My home will soon be in oblivion, and my name in the Pantheon! Here is my head! It will answer for everything!".4

The Committee of Public Safety reacted with fear—not of his arguments, but of his "overwhelming oratorical power".13 They knew they could not defeat him in a fair contest of words. Their solution was not to out-argue him but to silence him through bureaucratic means. Saint-Just rushed to the Convention and secured a new decree, tailor-made for the occasion, which allowed the Tribunal to exclude from the proceedings any defendant who "insults national justice".8 Robbed of his voice, Danton’s primary weapon was rendered useless. The institution had defeated the man. His struggle was over. "I will no longer defend myself," he cried. "Let me be led to death, I shall go to sleep in glory".8 On April 5, 1794, as he was led to the guillotine, his final words to the executioner were a last, defiant assertion of his public persona: "Show my head to the people. It is worth the trouble".8

This moment symbolized the ultimate triumph of institutionalized, bureaucratic terror over charismatic, populist leadership. Danton, the man of action and voice, was ultimately silenced and destroyed by the very paper-shuffling machinery of the state he had helped to build.

  

## Conclusion: The Legacy of Audacity

  

Georges Danton's career was a paradox, a brilliant and violent flash in the revolutionary storm. His oratory was the essential fuel for the Revolution's most critical moments, his calls for audacity instrumental in the overthrow of the monarchy and the mass mobilization that saved France from invasion.1 More than any other leader, he was a "man of the people," whose raw, improvisational style allowed him to enter into communion with the

sans-culottes and channel their passions into political force.8

Yet this unique power came at a terrible price. His willingness to ride the wave of popular fury made him complicit in the Revolution's worst excesses, most notably the September Massacres. He was a primary architect of the instruments of the Terror, from the revolutionary Commune to the Revolutionary Tribunal, only to be consumed by them in the end. His story is a cautionary tale of how revolutionary means can devour their own ends, and how the institutions created to defend a revolution can become the tools of its self-destruction.

Despite the persistent controversies surrounding his alleged venality and his ambiguous role in the violence of 1792, Danton's voice endures.8 His thundering call—

"de l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace!"—remains the most potent and concise expression of the revolutionary spirit itself: a terrifying, creative, and destructive willingness to dare everything in the pursuit of a new world.
