## I. Introduction: The Journalist as Revolutionary

  

The collapse of the Ancien Régime's censorship apparatus in the summer of 1789 unleashed a torrent of printed material that fundamentally reshaped the political landscape of France. For the first time in its history, the newspaper press was free, resulting in a media explosion of unprecedented scale.1 Where once a handful of state-sanctioned gazettes constituted the entirety of French journalism, the period between 1789 and 1799 saw the appearance of over 2,000 distinct newspaper titles.1 In Paris alone, the number of political bulletins mushroomed from a few to over three hundred between July 1789 and 1790.2 This proliferation transformed journalism from a staid, elite affair into a dynamic mass medium, a fiercely competitive commercial enterprise, and a primary engine of revolutionary mobilization.2 The press became the central arena where the Revolution's ideological battles were fought, its factions forged, and its enemies denounced.

Into this chaotic and fertile environment stepped Lucie-Simplice-Camille-Benoît Desmoulins, a man whose career would become emblematic of the power and peril of the revolutionary journalist. A classically-educated lawyer from Guise, Desmoulins was initially hampered by a persistent stammer that precluded a successful career in public oratory.3 Yet, this physical impediment belied a formidable literary talent. With a pen in his hand, his voice became one of the most articulate, witty, and savage of the era. He emerged onto the public stage with his electrifying call to arms in the gardens of the Palais-Royal on July 12, 1789, an act that helped precipitate the storming of the Bastille.3 This moment of action catapulted him to celebrity and, crucially, created an audience for his written work. Through a series of incendiary pamphlets, he rapidly cultivated a radical persona, earning the notorious moniker "Procureur-général de la lanterne" (Lanterne Prosecutor) for his gleeful justification of popular violence.4

This report argues that the complete publication history of Camille Desmoulins serves as a unique microcosm of the French Revolution's entire ideological trajectory. His journalistic evolution—from the exuberant, republican internationalism of Les Révolutions de France et de Brabant to the factional, self-devouring paranoia reflected and ultimately condemned in Le Vieux Cordelier—mirrors the Revolution's own path from universalist liberation to the Reign of Terror. His work demonstrates the dual, paradoxical power of the revolutionary press to both construct and destroy political movements, a force so potent that it ultimately consumed its own most brilliant practitioners. By examining the publication history, circulation, readership, and political impact of his works, we can trace not only the biography of a single journalist but the life cycle of the Revolution itself, from its hopeful birth to its cannibalistic climax.

## II. The Foundational Pamphlets: Forging a Radical Voice (1789)

  

Before he became the editor of two of the Revolution's most influential newspapers, Camille Desmoulins established his reputation and honed his radical voice through two foundational pamphlets published in the heady months of 1789. These works, La France Libre and Discours de la lanterne aux Parisiens, not only launched his career but also introduced the key elements of his style: audacious republicanism, a mastery of classical allusion, and a chilling embrace of popular violence as a legitimate political tool.

  

### La France Libre (July 1789): An Audacious Call for a Republic

  

La France Libre was a work of remarkable prescience and radicalism. Written in June 1789, a time when the vast majority of reformers and deputies to the Estates-General were focused on establishing a constitutional monarchy, Desmoulins's pamphlet made an explicit and uncompromising case for a republic.4 It presented a comprehensive indictment of the

ancien régime, methodically analyzing the rights and legitimacy of the king, the nobility, and the Roman Catholic clergy, and concluding that all were illegitimate vestiges of a bygone era.3 Desmoulins declared with fiery conviction that "popular and democratic government is the only constitution which suits France".5 Drawing on his classical education, he argued that France, having been enfranchised by forty years of Enlightenment philosophy, was ready to cast off its subjugation. In a striking turn of phrase, he hailed the national debt not as a crisis but as a catalyst: "O blessed deficit! O my dear Calonne!" he wrote, arguing that the fiscal collapse would force the nation to reclaim its sovereignty.8

The publication history of La France Libre reveals a crucial dynamic of the early Revolution: the symbiotic relationship between direct action and political propaganda. Despite its intellectual force, the pamphlet was initially too radical for the Parisian market; publishers refused to print it.4 It was Desmoulins's physical intervention in history—his impassioned speech at the Palais-Royal on July 12 that urged the crowd to take up arms—that created the necessary conditions for his words to find an audience.3 The subsequent storming of the Bastille made him an overnight celebrity, and on July 18, his once-unpublishable pamphlet was finally issued to "extraordinary success".4 A powerful feedback loop was established: Desmoulins's actions created the political capital and public appetite for his radical ideas, and the widespread dissemination of those ideas in print then solidified his status as a leading revolutionary figure, validating his actions and inspiring further radicalism. The pamphlet's success won him the attention and friendship of powerful figures like the Comte de Mirabeau, lending him a new level of prestige.4

  

### Discours de la lanterne aux Parisiens (September 1789): The Consecration of Popular Violence

  

If La France Libre established Desmoulins's ideological credentials, his second major pamphlet, Discours de la lanterne aux Parisiens, cemented his public persona and demonstrated his unique rhetorical genius. Published in September 1789, the work was an unapologetic "ode to revolutionary violence".4 Its central rhetorical device was the personification of the iron bracket of a streetlamp at the Place de Grève, which had been used by revolutionary crowds as a makeshift gallows for the summary execution of officials like Joseph-François Foulon and his son-in-law Bertier de Sauvigny.4 By giving voice to the lamppost, Desmoulins transformed an instrument of mob justice into a potent symbol of popular sovereignty.11 The pamphlet opens with the lantern thanking the "Brave Parisians" for making it "forever famous & blessed among all lanterns".11

The tone of the Discours is one of dark, satirical humor, designed to both shock and delight its audience. Its epigraph, a verse from the Gospel of John, "Qui male agit odit lucem" ("He who does evil hates the light"), is cheekily misattributed to Saint Matthew and translated with iconoclastic flair as "Les fripons ne veulent point de lanterne" ("The scoundrels don't want a lantern").5 This performance of irreverent wit, combined with a defense of the people's right to enact their own brutal justice, proved immensely popular. The pamphlet earned Desmoulins his famous nickname, the "Procureur-général de la lanterne".5

The work was more than a mere defense of lynching; it was a profound political statement that sought to legitimize a new, extra-legal form of popular justice. The slow, opaque, and privileged courts of the ancien régime were implicitly contrasted with the swift, transparent, and egalitarian judgment of the crowd. By having the lanterne speak, Desmoulins symbolically transferred the authority of justice from the established institutions—even the new National Assembly—to the immediate, visceral will of the Parisian people. The lamppost became the new gallows, the crowd the new judge and jury. This was a foundational text for the sans-culotte ideology of direct democracy and popular action, and it represented a radical challenge to the Assembly's claim to a monopoly on legitimate force. While it horrified moderates, even Maximilien Robespierre acknowledged its power, describing it as a "bizarre compound of truths and lies, of politics and absurdities, of sound views and of chimerical and particular projects".9

  

## III. Les Révolutions de France et de Brabant (Nov 1789 – July 1791): The Voice of the Uncompromising Republic

  

Following the success of his initial pamphlets, Camille Desmoulins launched his first and longest-running newspaper, Les Révolutions de France et de Brabant, in late November 1789. This weekly publication would cement his role as one of the Revolution's foremost journalists, providing a consistent platform for his evolving republicanism, his biting satire, and his relentless attacks on the remnants of the old order. For nearly two years, it was a leading voice of the radical press, shaping public opinion and pushing the revolutionary movement in an ever more uncompromising direction.

  

### Publication History and Operations

  

Les Révolutions de France et de Brabant ran for a total of 104 issues, from its first publication on November 28, 1789, to its last on December 12, 1791.12 Desmoulins was the principal author and director for the first 86 issues, a period of intense productivity that lasted until July 1791.15 His involvement ceased in the aftermath of the Champ de Mars Massacre, a violent suppression of republican demonstrators that he had helped to instigate. In a letter, Desmoulins confirmed he "solemnly gave my resignation as a journalist in my n° 86".14 The journal was continued by other writers, including Joseph-François-Nicolas Dusaulchoy, but Desmoulins's unique voice was its defining feature.15

The newspaper was structured as a weekly periodical, typically consisting of three pages of text accompanied by a single, often provocative, illustration.4 Its business operations, detailed in a prospectus, reveal a well-considered commercial enterprise.18 Subscriptions were sold for three-month terms, priced at 6 livres 15 sols for subscribers in Paris and 7 livres 10 sols for the provinces. This price included postage "franc de port par tout le royaume" (postage free throughout the kingdom), a significant incentive for readers outside the capital.18 In Paris, subscriptions were handled by the publisher and bookseller Garnéry, while a network of provincial postmasters and booksellers managed distribution across the country.18

This economic model provides a clear window into the realities of revolutionary journalism. While driven by ideology, the paper was also a commercial product competing in a newly liberalized and crowded market.19 The subscription price, though not exorbitant, suggests a target audience with some disposable income, primarily the literate bourgeoisie. At the same time, the deliberate effort to build a national readership through inclusive postal pricing demonstrates an ambition to influence opinion far beyond the Parisian political clubs. The paper's content—a compelling mixture of radical politics, sharp satire, and eye-catching illustrations—was carefully crafted to be a sellable commodity, capable of attracting and retaining a subscriber base in a fiercely competitive environment.2

  

### Readership and Circulation

  

While precise circulation figures for Les Révolutions de France et de Brabant are not available in the surviving records, its scale and influence can be estimated from contextual data. Desmoulins's later claim that a rival paper, Révolutions de Paris, had 200,000 readers is widely considered a wild exaggeration.20 A more realistic benchmark comes from other popular radical papers of the era, such as the

Annales patriotiques, which achieved print runs of 10,000 to 12,000 copies.2 The ultra-royalist

Ami du Roi had 5,700 subscribers, a figure considered impressive at the time.2 Given the documented popularity and notoriety of Desmoulins's journal, a circulation in the high thousands, likely approaching or even exceeding 10,000 copies per week, is a plausible estimate.

This circulation figure, however, represents only a fraction of its total readership. In the social context of revolutionary Paris, newspapers were a communal resource. A single copy purchased by subscription would be shared and read aloud in cafés, reading rooms, and the halls of political clubs, multiplying its reach tenfold or more.2 This collective consumption meant that the paper's ideas could permeate society far beyond its subscriber base, reaching a broad cross-section of the population, including the semi-literate

sans-culottes.

The paper's content was designed to appeal to this dual audience. Its "eloquent writing style and his frequent allusions to antiquity" catered to a "wider-read," educated readership steeped in the classics.4 Desmoulins's prose was sophisticated and erudite, pleasing a cultivated audience.24 Simultaneously, its "shocking yet patriotic subject matter," its attacks on policies impeding the "democratic movement," and its unwavering republicanism resonated deeply with the radical artisans and shopkeepers who formed the backbone of the Cordeliers Club and the Parisian popular movement.3

### Rhetorical Arsenal and Core Arguments

  

The style of Les Révolutions de France et de Brabant was a unique and potent combination of "political reportage, revolutionary polemics, satire, and cultural commentary".5 Desmoulins announced in his prospectus that "The universe and all its follies... shall be included in the jurisdiction of this hypercritical journal".5 His writing was witty, intensely personal, and often vicious, employing savage invective against his political opponents.5 His classical education at the Collège Louis-le-Grand was a defining feature of his prose; the paper is replete with allusions to Roman history and figures like Cicero and Tacitus, which served to elevate contemporary political struggles by framing them in the grand tradition of republican virtue versus tyranny.4

The newspaper's core arguments were consistently anti-royalist and pro-republican.5 A central and revealing theme was its internationalist perspective on revolution, encapsulated in its very title. The ongoing Brabant Revolution in the Austrian Netherlands was not seen as a foreign affair but as an integral part of the same universal struggle for liberty. Desmoulins declared that the principal goal of his paper was to document "the propagation of civism & of philosophy among all peoples," viewing the concurrent revolutions as a "beautiful spectacle" that would "necessarily shake all the thrones of Europe".15 This worldview reflects the initial, optimistic, and expansionist phase of the French Revolution, which saw itself as a beacon of liberty for all humankind. This contrasts sharply with the later, more insular and paranoid phase of the Revolution during the Terror, when the primary focus shifted from exporting liberty to purging domestic enemies. The title of Desmoulins's first newspaper stands as a monument to that initial, universalist vision.

Throughout its run, the paper relentlessly attacked any hint of compromise with the monarchy. In May 1790, for instance, when the National Assembly debated whether the king or the legislature should hold the power to declare war, Desmoulins scathingly critiqued the resulting compromise that granted the king a role. He questioned why revolutionaries would celebrate a decree that left so much power in royal hands, using the joyful reaction of the royal family as proof of its flawed nature.30

  

### Political Influence and Cessation (1789-1791)

  

Les Révolutions de France et de Brabant quickly became a major organ of the radical left. It was the unofficial voice of the Cordeliers Club, the populist political society that Desmoulins joined in February 1790 and where he, alongside Georges Danton, became a leading figure.5 The paper served as a primary vehicle for the club's radical agenda, amplifying its calls for greater democracy and surveillance of the government.

Its influence was also defined by its fierce polemical battles. The paper engaged in a "continual war of insults" with the royalist press, most notably the Actes des Apôtres, which mockingly nicknamed Desmoulins "l'ânon des moulins" ("the jackass of the windmills") in a pun on his surname.5 But his attacks were not reserved for royalists. His savagery alienated former allies and powerful moderates. His friendships with the Comte de Mirabeau and the Baron Malouet soured over what they perceived as libelous attacks. Malouet was so incensed that he publicly questioned Desmoulins's sanity and called for his arrest.4

The paper's influence reached its zenith in the summer of 1791, following the royal family's failed Flight to Varennes. The event confirmed Desmoulins's darkest warnings about the king's untrustworthiness. He seized the moment, intensifying his campaign for the immediate deposition of Louis XVI and the establishment of a republic.3 This radical agitation, promoted through his paper and voiced through the Cordeliers Club, led directly to the drafting of a republican petition and the organization of a mass demonstration on the Champ de Mars on July 17, 1791.4

The demonstration ended in bloodshed when the National Guard, under the command of the Marquis de Lafayette, fired on the crowd. In the repressive political climate that followed the massacre, the authorities cracked down on the republican movement. A warrant was issued for Desmoulins's arrest, forcing him into hiding and compelling him to cease his journalistic activities.3 His editorship of

Les Révolutions de France et de Brabant ended with issue #86. He had become too radical for the fragile constitutional monarchy, and his own pen had made him a target of the state he had helped to create.

  

## IV. Le Vieux Cordelier (Dec 1793 – Feb 1794): The Pen Against the Terror

  

After a hiatus of more than a year from journalism, Camille Desmoulins returned to the press in December 1793 with his final, most famous, and ultimately fatal publication, Le Vieux Cordelier ("The Old Cordelier"). This series of periodical pamphlets was not a newspaper in the conventional sense but a sequence of powerful, essay-like interventions into the deadliest phase of the Revolution. Its brief, brilliant run of seven issues (only six of which were published in his lifetime) charts Desmoulins's dramatic and courageous turn against the Reign of Terror, a stand that would lead directly to his own execution and serve as the definitive testament to the lethal nature of political journalism in the Year II.

  

### Genesis in Factional Conflict

  

The launch of Le Vieux Cordelier cannot be understood outside the context of the intense factional struggles that gripped the Jacobin government in the autumn of 1793. The Committee of Public Safety, with Maximilien Robespierre as its leading voice, found itself caught between two opposing factions. On the left were the "ultra-revolutionaries" or Hébertists, followers of Jacques-René Hébert, whose popular newspaper Le Père Duchesne championed radical de-Christianization and an intensification of the Terror.32 On the right were the "Indulgents," a moderate faction coalescing around Georges Danton, who argued that the Terror had served its purpose and should be relaxed.3

Desmoulins, a close friend of both Danton and Robespierre, launched Le Vieux Cordelier with the initial encouragement and approval of Robespierre himself.3 Robespierre, wary of the atheistic and anarchic tendencies of the Hébertists, saw Desmoulins's sharp pen as a powerful weapon to discredit and destroy this rival faction.24 The very name of the journal was a calculated polemical strike. By calling it "The Old Cordelier," Desmoulins laid claim to the original, "pure" spirit of the Cordeliers Club, implicitly arguing that the club's legacy had been hijacked by the extremist Hébertists who had come to dominate it.33 The paper was intended as a tool for Robespierre's political ends, but Desmoulins would soon turn this weapon against its sponsor.

  

### A Number-by-Number Analysis of the Descent

  

The seven issues of Le Vieux Cordelier document a rapid and perilous political evolution, moving from sanctioned factional attack to open rebellion against the entire system of the Terror.

- Issues 1 & 2 (December 5 & 10, 1793): The first two numbers adhered to the agreed-upon strategy. Desmoulins launched a talented and violent diatribe against the Hébertists, denouncing them as foreign agents in the pay of William Pitt and attacking their campaign of de-Christianization.26 He praised Robespierre lavishly, positioning himself as a loyal ally of the Committee of Public Safety in its struggle against the "ultras".33 These initial issues were approved by Robespierre, who was reportedly shown the proofs before publication.36
    
- Issue 3 (December 15, 1793): The Turn to Allegory: The third issue marked a dramatic shift in tone and strategy. Desmoulins employed what contemporaries would have recognized as "Aesopian language"—a form of indirect critique through historical parallel.33 He filled the issue with long, translated passages from the Roman historian Tacitus, which described the oppressive reign of the Emperor Tiberius.26 The parallel was unmistakable: the accounts of a "civilization turned sick by fear and brutality," where suspicion was a death sentence and informers grew rich on the property of the condemned, was a thinly veiled portrait of revolutionary Paris under the Terror.26 This issue contained the first open call for a change in policy, advocating for the release of prisoners and signaling a move toward peace.26
    
- Issue 4 (December 20, 1793): The Point of No Return: Described as "explosive," the fourth number abandoned allegory for direct, frontal assault on the core tenets and mechanisms of the Terror.26 Desmoulins took up the cause of the 200,000 "suspects" languishing in prisons and issued his famous appeal for a "Committee of Clemency" to counter the excesses of the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security.26 He directly attacked the legal basis of the Terror, arguing against the Law of Suspects by stating, "...in the Declaration of Rights there is no house of suspicion... there are no suspected persons, only those convicted of crimes fixed by the law".26 In a direct challenge to his old friend, he counseled Robespierre not to attempt to build a Republic on the "rare quality as virtue" and mocked the sheer folly of a policy that sought to eliminate all enemies by guillotine, noting that for every one man executed, ten new enemies are made from his family and friends.26
    
- Issues 5, 6, & 7 (January–February 1794): The Final Struggle: The reaction to Issue 4 was immediate and severe. In Issue 5 (published January 5, 1794), Desmoulins attempted a "justificatory discourse" to the Jacobins, trying to walk back the most direct challenges while still maintaining his call for an end to the Terror.26 It was too late. He was denounced and, on January 10, expelled from the Jacobin Club.26 Issue 6 was delayed by the publisher, Desenne, who feared for his own life.26 When it finally appeared in early February, it contained Desmoulins's most famous retort to Robespierre's demand at the Jacobin Club that the offending issues be burned: "Brûler n'est pas répondre" ("To burn is not to answer").35 This phrase became a legendary defense of press freedom against tyranny. The seventh and final number, which contained a direct plea for freedom of the press and a dialogue on the subject, was never published in his lifetime; the manuscript was seized upon his arrest.26
    

  

### Circulation, Reception, and Downfall

  

Le Vieux Cordelier was not a fringe pamphlet; it was a media sensation. The journal achieved a massive circulation estimated at 100,000 copies.26 To put this figure in perspective, it was nearly twenty times the subscription base of the most popular royalist paper and nearly ten times that of other successful radical journals. This unprecedented reach is the key to understanding the severity of the government's reaction. Desmoulins was not merely whispering dissent; he was broadcasting it to a mass audience across Paris and the provinces.

The political fallout was swift and decisive. The call for a "Committee of Clemency" in Issue 4 was the final straw. Desmoulins was publicly denounced at the Jacobin Club and expelled from the Cordeliers.26 Robespierre, his schoolmate and protector, publicly broke with him. In a speech at the Jacobins on January 7, 1794, Robespierre demanded that the "offending numbers of the journal be publicly burnt," a symbolic act of political excommunication.3 This public repudiation officially branded Desmoulins, Danton, and their allies as a dangerous counter-revolutionary faction—the "Indulgents".38

The history of Le Vieux Cordelier exemplifies the weaponization of journalism in the factional purges of 1794. The process began with Robespierre using Desmoulins's pen as a targeted weapon against the Hébertists. However, when that same powerful weapon was turned against the system of the Terror itself, the state reacted with lethal force. The newspaper's own words became the primary evidence in the case against its author. The call for clemency was twisted into proof of a conspiracy to weaken the Republic and aid its enemies. The trial of the Dantonists in April 1794 was, in large part, a trial of Le Vieux Cordelier.38 In the superheated atmosphere of the Terror, political debate in the press was no longer possible. Journalism had become a zero-sum game where publishing the losing argument was a capital crime. In the early hours of March 31, 1794, Desmoulins was arrested. He was tried alongside Danton and executed by guillotine on April 5.26

  

## V. Conclusion: The Journalist Devoured by the Revolution

  

The journalistic career of Camille Desmoulins is a powerful and tragic narrative that mirrors the French Revolution's own arc from liberating idealism to self-destructive terror. He entered the political stage as a champion of absolute press freedom, famously declaring that "the real palladium is the declaration of rights, it is freedom of the press".42 He wielded this freedom with unmatched brilliance and recklessness, helping to tear down the Bastille, the monarchy, and the Girondin faction.5 Yet, when he turned his pen against the guillotine and the excesses of the very government he had helped to install, he was devoured by the revolutionary forces he had so effectively unleashed. His story is the ultimate testament to the profound and perilous power of the press in a time of radical upheaval.

Desmoulins's trajectory traces the Revolution's shifting ideological currents. He began with the boundless, internationalist optimism of Les Révolutions de France et de Brabant, which envisioned the French struggle as the dawn of universal liberty that would "shake all the thrones of Europe".15 This early work, aimed at a national audience of educated and patriotic citizens, was instrumental in driving the push for a republic, particularly after the King's Flight to Varennes.3 His influence was pivotal in galvanizing the radicalism of the Cordeliers Club and shaping the uncompromising republican sentiment that led to the overthrow of the monarchy.

His final work, Le Vieux Cordelier, emerged in a transformed political world, one of factional paranoia and state-sanctioned terror. Initially conceived as a weapon for Robespierre against the Hébertists, the paper became the vehicle for Desmoulins's own crisis of conscience. His call for a "Committee of Clemency" and his eloquent critique of the Terror—reaching an astonishing 100,000 readers—was an act of immense political courage.26 It was also a fatal miscalculation. In the logic of the Year II, to call for moderation was to confess to treason. His famous retort, "To burn is not to answer," was a noble defense of free expression, but it was an argument the Committee of Public Safety had no interest in hearing.35 The newspaper itself became the central indictment against him, its pages providing the prosecution with all the evidence needed to send him and the Dantonist faction to their deaths.38

Ultimately, Camille Desmoulins exemplifies the quintessential revolutionary journalist. He was, as Robespierre once observed, "a bizarre mix of truth and lies, politics and absurdity, healthy views and strange chimerical projects" 33—a description that could equally apply to the Revolution itself. His publications demonstrate that the revolutionary press was not merely a reflection of events but an active agent in their creation. His pen incited insurrections, dismantled political factions, and articulated the highest ideals of republicanism. His tragic end serves as a stark and enduring lesson: the same revolutionary fervor that empowers the press to topple an old regime can, in its most extreme form, become pathologically intolerant of the very criticism and freedom of thought upon which a just republic must be founded.35 He died a victim of the principle he had championed, a journalist consumed by the revolution he had helped to write into existence.
