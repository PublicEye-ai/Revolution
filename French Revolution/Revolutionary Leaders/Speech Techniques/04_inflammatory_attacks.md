# The Homer of Filth: An Analysis of the Inflammatory Propaganda of Hébert's Le Père Duchesne

  ![[The _Homer of Filth__ How Hébert's Propaganda Machine Radicalized the French Revolution.mp3]]
  

## Introduction

  

This report will argue that Jacques-René Hébert, through his newspaper Le Père Duchesne, developed and deployed a uniquely effective, albeit brutally inflammatory, style of propaganda that was instrumental in mobilizing the Parisian sans-culottes, radicalizing the French Revolution, and eliminating his political enemies. By examining his escalating attacks on Marie Antoinette, Louis XVI, the clergy, and rival revolutionaries like the Girondins, we can trace the evolution of the Terror's political logic. Ultimately, the very methods that brought Hébert to the apex of his influence created an unsustainable political environment of perpetual purge that led to his own destruction.

The collapse of Old Regime censorship in 1789 unleashed an unprecedented explosion of print media across France.1 Between 1789 and 1799, over 1,300 new newspapers emerged, competing for the attention of a newly politicized public.2 Amidst this cacophony of voices, Jacques-René Hébert's

Le Père Duchesne rose to a position of extraordinary prominence.3 Published from September 1790 until his death in March 1794, Hébert's paper became one of the most successful and feared publications of the Revolution, its title synonymous with the most extreme faction of Parisian radicalism.3 This report will dissect the architecture of Hébert's propaganda, analyze his campaigns against a succession of perceived enemies, and evaluate the ultimate legacy of his incendiary rhetoric.

  

## The Architecture of Outrage: Hébert's Propaganda Machine

  

The phenomenal influence of Le Père Duchesne was not accidental; it was the product of a sophisticated and calculated propaganda strategy. Hébert constructed a media machine perfectly calibrated to resonate with and mobilize the Parisian working class. This machine was built upon three pillars: a carefully crafted populist persona, a theatrical and accessible narrative style, and a distribution network subsidized by the state itself.

  

### The Persona of Père Duchesne: The "Homer of Filth"

  

An examination of Jacques-René Hébert's background reveals a calculated, almost theatrical approach to his revolutionary identity. Born into a bourgeois family, Hébert arrived in Paris in 1780 and struggled for a decade, even trying his hand as a playwright without success.6 The Revolution provided him with a new stage. Instead of presenting himself, he adopted the pre-existing comic folk character of Père Duchesne—an irascible, pipe-smoking stove merchant—and transformed him into a radical political icon.6 This persona, depicted on the paper's masthead in the simple trousers (

pantalons) and Phrygian cap of the sans-culottes, allowed Hébert, who later lived a comfortable "genteel bourgeois" life, to speak with a credible and potent plebeian voice.4 This gap between the publisher's reality and his public persona highlights the performative nature of revolutionary identity during the Terror and the opportunism the period afforded.

The voice of Père Duchesne was the key to his connection with the sans-culottes. Hébert employed a raw, vulgar, and scatological style, deliberately transgressing the polished norms of elite discourse.9 His pages were littered with profanity, with the expletives "

foutre!" (fuck!) and "bougre!" (bugger!) serving as a form of revolutionary punctuation.12 This linguistic choice was strategic. It created an immediate bond with his working-class readers, reflecting their speech and validating their culture in opposition to the perceived effete mannerisms of the aristocracy. The French historian Ferdinand Brunot aptly dubbed Hébert "the Homer of filth," recognizing his unique ability to wield coarse language as a powerful tool of mass communication.7 By speaking the language of the street, Hébert ensured his readers not only understood but also listened to and acted upon his message.7

  

### Theatricality and Narrative Structure

  

Hébert's background as a failed playwright informed the very structure of his newspaper. Each eight-page, in-octavo issue, published three times a week, typically functioned as a single, sustained polemic rather than a collection of disparate news items.5 The content often took the form of a one-act play or a dramatic monologue, with Père Duchesne at the center of the action.9

A recurring narrative device was the fictitious conversation between Père Duchesne and the Revolution's most prominent figures. He would recount imaginary visits to the Tuileries Palace or the Temple prison, where he would lecture Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, expose their plots, and report their supposed confessions.7 These theatrical dialogues served a dual purpose: they made complex political issues like the royal veto or the Civil List immediately accessible and compelling, and they transformed the paper into a kind of political serial (

feuilleton), with each installment eagerly awaited by a growing readership.9 Street hawkers would amplify this drama, shouting headlines like, "

Il est bougrement en colère aujourd'hui le père Duchesne!" ("Father Duchesne is very angry today!").7 This theatricality was a key component of the paper's success, turning political indoctrination into popular entertainment.

  

### State-Sponsored Incitement: Circulation and Influence

  

While the exact circulation numbers of Le Père Duchesne remain unknown, it was unquestionably one of the most successful papers of its time, its popularity soaring after the assassination of Jean-Paul Marat in July 1793 made it the undisputed leading radical journal in Paris.6 Other major revolutionary papers achieved print runs of 10,000–12,000 copies, and the total daily circulation of Parisian newspapers in 1791 was around 130,000.1

Crucially, Hébert's influence was magnified by official state patronage. This support elevates his publication from mere journalism to semi-official propaganda, demonstrating that he was not simply reflecting popular opinion but was an active, state-sanctioned agent of radicalization. Beginning in 1792, the Paris Commune and the Ministry of War, under Hébert's political allies Jean-Nicolas Pache and Jean-Baptiste Bouchotte, began purchasing thousands of copies of Le Père Duchesne for free distribution to the public and, most significantly, to soldiers in the army.7 In May and June 1793 alone, the government purchased copies to "enlighten and animate their patriotism," a contract from which Hébert was estimated to have received 205,000 livres.8 This government funding provided Hébert with a vast, guaranteed audience and a stamp of official legitimacy. It reveals a feedback loop in which a powerful political faction used public funds to manufacture popular consent for its own extremist agenda, including the violent purges of its rivals.

## The Demonization of the Queen: The Campaign Against Marie Antoinette

  

No single figure endured more of Hébert's venom than Queen Marie Antoinette. From the earliest issues of Le Père Duchesne, she was a perennial target, serving as the embodiment of all that was wrong with the monarchy. His campaign against her was relentless, deeply personal, and escalated in viciousness until it culminated in one of the most shocking accusations of the entire Revolution.

  

### The Perennial Target: "Madame Veto" and "l'Autrichienne"

  

Even during the period when he professed support for a constitutional monarchy, Hébert was consistently hostile toward the queen.7 He skillfully played on popular prejudices, relentlessly attacking her as "

l'Autrichienne" (the Austrian woman), a perpetual foreigner conspiring with France's enemies.10 He helped popularize the derisive nickname "

Madame Veto," linking her directly to the crown's efforts to obstruct the will of the National Assembly.7 These attacks built upon the salacious pre-revolutionary pamphlets, or

libelles, which had long portrayed her as profligate, promiscuous, and politically meddlesome.20

The royal family's failed flight to Varennes in June 1791 marked a significant turning point, and Hébert's rhetoric intensified dramatically. In the immediate aftermath, issue No. 61 of Le Père Duchesne was dedicated to a furious tirade against the royal couple. In it, Hébert unleashes a torrent of sexualized and dehumanizing insults against the queen, calling her a "putain" (whore) and a "Messaline débauchée" (debauched Messalina), a reference to the notoriously promiscuous wife of the Roman Emperor Claudius.17 He declared that while the king should be locked in the Charenton asylum, his "whore" should be thrown into the Hôpital de la Salpêtrière, a public institution that served as a prison for prostitutes and the mentally ill.17 This was a clear and brutal call for her complete social and political annihilation.

  

### The Ultimate Taboo: The Incest Accusation at Trial

  

Hébert's campaign against the queen reached its nadir during her trial before the Revolutionary Tribunal in October 1793.21 Called as a witness, Hébert unleashed his final and most infamous weapon: the accusation of incest.8 He testified that during the royal family's imprisonment, the queen had engaged in "sordid debauchery" with her own eight-year-old son, Louis-Charles.24 He claimed that the boy's guardian, the cobbler Antoine Simon, had discovered the child engaging in "lewd acts" and that the boy, after being coerced, had signed a deposition stating that his mother and his aunt, Madame Élisabeth, had taught him to masturbate and had participated with him.24

This accusation was a calculated act of psychological warfare, designed to strip Marie Antoinette of her last remaining shred of public sympathy: her status as a mother. By leveling a charge so monstrous it seemed to place her outside the bounds of nature itself, Hébert sought to make her execution appear not merely as a political necessity but as a moral purification of the Republic.27 The goal was to destroy her character so completely that no one could view her as a victim.

However, this final attack demonstrated the limits of vituperation. The charge was so grotesque that it momentarily backfired. According to contemporary accounts, the accusation was met with murmurs of disgust in the courtroom, and the queen's emotional response—"If I have not replied, it is because Nature itself refuses to respond to such a charge laid against a mother"—visibly moved the audience, including the market women who had once been her most hostile critics.23 The overreach was not lost on Hébert's political rivals. Maximilien Robespierre was reportedly furious, calling Hébert an "imbecile" for an attack so vile that it risked generating sympathy for the crown and making the revolutionaries look like depraved monsters.29 This miscalculation revealed that even the most skillful propagandist could misjudge the moral boundaries of his audience, providing his enemies with ammunition to portray him as not just radical, but dangerously unhinged.

  

## To Kill a King: The Vilification of Louis XVI

  

While Marie Antoinette was Hébert's most consistent personal target, his attacks on Louis XVI were central to his broader project of dismantling the monarchy. His rhetoric evolved in lockstep with the radicalization of the Revolution, moving from conditional support to a relentless campaign of vilification designed to strip the king of his sacred authority and pave the way for his execution. This was a systematic process of linguistic de-sacralization; to physically kill the king, Hébert first had to rhetorically destroy the idea of the King.

  

### From "Father of the People" to "Cowardly Deserter"

  

In the early phase of the Revolution, from 1790 into 1792, Le Père Duchesne expressed a willingness to accept a constitutional monarchy.7 The King was still, at times, referred to as the "father of the people".30 This tolerance evaporated with the King's attempted flight to Varennes in June 1791. The event provided Hébert with the ultimate proof of royal treachery, and he immediately unleashed the full force of his invective.

Issue No. 61 stands as a monument to this turning point.17 In a direct address to Louis, Père Duchesne screams, "You my King. You are no longer my King, no longer my King! You are nothing but a cowardly deserter".17 This single phrase negates the king's fundamental role as the nation's leader. Hébert continues, stripping him of any status whatsoever: "You, King? You are not even a citizen. You will be lucky to avoid leaving your head on a scaffold for having sought the slaughter of so many men".17 By branding him a "vile perjurer" who had repeatedly broken his constitutional oath, Hébert reframed the monarch not as a misguided sovereign but as a common criminal who had forfeited all claims to loyalty and legitimacy.17

  

### Stripping the Mantle of Majesty: From "King" to "Drunkard"

  

Following the flight to Varennes, Hébert's language worked systematically to replace the symbols of majesty with epithets of degeneracy and monstrosity. In that same issue No. 61, he paints the king as a grotesque creature of insatiable greed, a "royal cannibal" who "devours all the cash" and, after converting "the people's bread into gold," remains "ravenous for whatever money we have left".17 This potent metaphor inverted the traditional image of the king as a nurturing father into a devouring beast, preying on his own people.

As the king's trial approached in late 1792, Hébert adopted a new, even more degrading moniker: "l'ivrogne du Temple" (the drunkard of the Temple).12 This insult was a masterstroke of populist propaganda. It stripped away the last vestiges of royal mystique, reducing the descendant of Saint Louis to a pathetic, common alcoholic confined to his prison. This linguistic demotion was crucial. It made the act of regicide psychologically palatable for the public. One does not execute a sacred king, an act freighted with centuries of religious and political taboo. One simply executes a drunken traitor, a squalid and necessary piece of sanitation for the new Republic. When the Convention seemed to hesitate, Père Duchesne roared with impatience, demanding they stop "marching on tiptoe" and execute "the drunkard of the Temple".12

  

## War on the Ancien Régime: Targeting Aristocrats and Clergy

  

Beyond the royal family, Hébert waged a relentless propaganda war against the two foundational pillars of the Ancien Régime: the aristocracy and the clergy. He portrayed both groups as irredeemable enemies of the Revolution, conspirators who had to be purged for the Republic to survive. His attacks were characterized by broad generalizations, dehumanizing language, and direct incitement to violence.

  

### The Aristocracy: A Monolithic Enemy

  

In the pages of Le Père Duchesne, the aristocracy was never a diverse group of individuals but a monolithic bloc of traitors. From his earliest pamphlets, Hébert defined aristocrats as "enemies of the constitution" who were perpetually "conspiring against the nation".7 He employed a range of dehumanizing epithets, referring to them as "

brigands couronnés" (crowned brigands) and, in a phrase that echoed his attacks on the king, "mangeurs d'hommes" (man-eaters).5

The purpose of this rhetoric was not merely to criticize but to incite. Hébert and his followers, the Hébertists, argued that France could only be truly reborn through the complete elimination of the old noble class.7 His paper became a primary vehicle for demanding their extermination. Following a victory against foreign armies, he crowed, "Aristocrats, you are going to eat cheese!"—a crude threat implying their imminent demise.5 This violent sentiment was later immortalized in

Le Chanson du Père Dûchene, an anarchist anthem that inherited Hébert's inflammatory spirit, explicitly calling on the people to "Hang your landlord" and declaring that bosses and the bourgeois "deserve the lamppost".31

  

### The "Calotins": Hébert's Dechristianization Campaign

  

Hébert's assault on the Catholic Church was even more ferocious and systematic. He became one of the foremost leaders of the dechristianization movement that swept France in 1793–94.6 His newspaper was the campaign's most powerful mouthpiece, relentlessly attacking priests, particularly those who refused to swear allegiance to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy.

He derisively labeled them "calotins," a contemptuous slang term for clergymen, and "prêtres imposteurs" (impostor priests).13 The paper's masthead vignette evolved to depict Père Duchesne with an axe raised over a cowering priest, under the chilling motto "

Memento mori" (Remember you must die).5 His theatrical narratives were filled with scenes of anti-clerical violence, such as Père Duchesne gleefully describing his desire to "whip the fuck out of" the conservative Abbé Maury.12

Hébert's propaganda against the clergy was a textbook example of psychological projection. At the very moment the Hébertists were championing the Terror and calling for mass violence, he accused his clerical enemies of the exact same methods. In issue No. 234, published during the anti-republican revolt in the Vendée, he painted a horrifying picture of priests as the primary instigators of civil war. He claimed that "crapulous monks" and "refractory priests," vomited onto French shores by the English, were running through the countryside "armed with daggers and crucifixes," inciting massacres, rape, and the burning of villages.18 This rhetorical strategy served two functions: it dehumanized the clergy, casting them as violent fanatics, and it framed revolutionary violence as a necessary act of pre-emptive self-defense. By attributing his own faction's methods to the enemy, he justified their persecution. The institutional culmination of this campaign was the conversion of some 2,000 churches, including the iconic Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, into "Temples of Reason," a movement in which Hébert and his followers were instrumental.6 In one issue, he summarized his worldview succinctly: "The religion of slaves will never be that of a free people".13

  

## Purging the Revolution: The Assault on the Girondins and Other Rivals

  

As the Revolution progressed, Hébert's definition of "enemy" became increasingly fluid, expanding to include not just remnants of the Old Regime but fellow revolutionaries who were deemed insufficiently radical. His propaganda machine, once aimed at external targets, was turned inward with devastating effect. The campaign against the Girondin faction, in particular, showcased how the logic of the Terror began to consume its own.

  

### The Campaign Against the Girondins

  

Hébert was a leading figure in the power struggle between the radical Montagnards and the more moderate Girondin faction in the National Convention.6 His newspaper was the primary weapon used to mobilize the sans-culottes against them. He masterfully branded the Girondins as a cohesive, counter-revolutionary conspiracy, plastering them with labels like "Brissotins" (after their leader, Jacques Pierre Brissot) and "Rolandins" (after the influential Madame Roland).19

He reframed what was essentially a political and ideological conflict as a battle against treason. In issue No. 231, titled "The Great Anger of Père Duchesne," he accused the Girondins, along with royalists, of a plot to "destroy all the patriots by hunger, fire, and poison" and of being behind the assassination of the revolutionary martyr Louis-Michel Lepeletier.19 He declared with fury that after having destroyed the tyranny of the king, the people would not allow the Girondins to erect an "even more odious tyranny" in its place.39 This relentless barrage of accusations, portraying the Girondins as secret royalists and federalists seeking to dismember the Republic, directly fueled the popular insurrections of May 31–June 2, 1793.6 These Hébert-stoked uprisings forced the Convention to capitulate, leading to the arrest and eventual execution of the leading Girondin deputies.6 In a subsequent issue, Père Duchesne expressed his "great joy" at their downfall, celebrating the purge of the "statesmen" who had wanted to save the "drunkard Capet".19

  

### Attacking Former Heroes and Moderates

  

The Girondins were not the first revolutionaries to find themselves in Hébert's crosshairs. His method involved a constant purity test, where yesterday's hero could become today's traitor if they failed to keep pace with his escalating radicalism.

Early in the Revolution, he targeted the finance minister Jacques Necker. Playing on popular anxieties about food shortages and economic hardship, he dismissed Necker as a "marchand de farine" (flour merchant) who made his fortune speculating on grain and would "screw the camp, without paying for it".41 After the Champ de Mars Massacre in July 1791, where National Guard troops fired on petitioners, Hébert turned decisively against the heroes of 1789. The Marquis de Lafayette, once lauded, was now denounced as a traitor, as was the mayor of Paris, Jean Sylvain Bailly.7 This pattern demonstrates a critical dynamic of the Terror: the definition of "enemy" was not fixed but was constantly redefined to encompass anyone perceived as an obstacle to the most radical agenda. Political disagreement was systematically reframed as a capital crime, a deadly precedent that would ultimately be turned against Hébert himself.

  

## Conclusion: The Cannibalistic Logic of Incitement

  

The career of Jacques-René Hébert is a testament to the power of inflammatory propaganda in a revolutionary age. His newspaper, Le Père Duchesne, was a brutally effective instrument for mobilizing the Parisian masses, channeling their grievances, and directing their rage against a succession of targets. His vitriol helped topple a monarchy, drive the dechristianization campaign, and purge the Revolution of its moderate factions. However, the very methods that propelled him to the apex of his influence contained the seeds of his own destruction.

Hébert's downfall came when he attempted to deploy his well-honed tactics against the centralizing power of the Committee of Public Safety. In March 1794, facing food shortages and popular discontent, he and his followers at the Cordeliers Club called for a new insurrection, this time aimed at Robespierre's government.6 It was a fatal miscalculation. The sans-culottes, exhausted by years of turmoil and with their most immediate needs addressed by the Terror's economic controls, did not respond to his call.6 The power of the street, which Hébert had so expertly wielded, had been superseded by the institutionalized power of the Committee.

Robespierre and his allies, who had long regarded the Hébertists' extremism and atheism as dangerous and destabilizing, seized the opportunity.4 They had Hébert and seventeen of his most prominent followers arrested on March 14, 1794. Accused of being foreign agents plotting to starve Paris and overthrow the Republic—the very sort of conspiracy charges he had leveled against so many others—Hébert was tried and sent to the guillotine just ten days later.5 On the way to the scaffold, the man who had sent so many to their deaths with his vitriolic pen reportedly fainted multiple times.22

The execution of the Hébertists was a pivotal moment. It marked the end of the popular, mass-movement phase of the French Revolution. By eliminating the chief spokesman for the sans-culottes, the Committee of Public Safety broke the power of the Parisian sections and alienated the radical base that had brought them to power.6 As the Jacobin leader Saint-Just observed, with the fall of the Hébertists, "the revolution is frozen".7 This act cleared the political stage for the Thermidorian Reaction a few months later, which would dismantle the machinery of the Terror and usher in an era dominated by the interests of the propertied bourgeoisie.

Hébert's legacy is thus a deeply paradoxical one. He was a master propagandist whose inflammatory rhetoric was a key driver of the Revolution's radical trajectory. Yet the political culture he fostered—one of perpetual outrage, suspicion, and purity-testing—was ultimately cannibalistic. It created a dynamic where today's purger was destined to become tomorrow's purged. The "Homer of filth" demonstrated the immense power of populist rage when channeled through the mass media, but also the inherent self-destructive nature of a revolution fueled by such unchecked and inflammatory passions.
