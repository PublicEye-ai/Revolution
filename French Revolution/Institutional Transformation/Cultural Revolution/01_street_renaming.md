# The Republic of Streets: Toponymic Revolution in France, 1789-1799

## Introduction: Rewriting the Urban Text

  

The city is a political palimpsest, a landscape upon which successive regimes inscribe their ideologies, overwriting the texts of their predecessors. Nowhere is this more evident than in France during its Revolution, where the urban environment—and particularly its nomenclature—became a primary battleground for political memory and public instruction.1 Before 1789, the names of streets, squares, and towns reflected a divinely ordained hierarchy, a "sacred geography" dedicated to the monarchy and the Catholic Church.1 With the collapse of the

Ancien Régime, revolutionaries undertook a systematic project to rewrite this urban text. The goal was not merely administrative tidiness but a profound cultural and psychological re-engineering of the nation.

This toponymic revolution was a dual project of erasure and inscription. First, it sought to methodically purge the landscape of all reminders of "royalty, feudalism, or superstition," as a key decree would later phrase it.2 The names of kings, queens, saints, and aristocrats were seen as daily affirmations of a deposed tyranny, and their removal was a symbolic act of purification. Second, revolutionaries aimed to inscribe a new civic catechism onto the map, creating a new sacred geography dedicated to the Republic, its abstract virtues, its martyred heroes, and its philosophical forefathers.1 This process was intended to transform streets from passive spaces of transit into active instruments of public pedagogy, constantly reminding citizens of their new identity and the principles for which the Revolution stood.

This report analyzes the process, content, and impact of this toponymic revolution from 1789 through the Directory. It will argue that while the renaming campaign was a profound and systematic expression of the Revolution's most radical ambitions to create a new society from first principles, its ultimate failure to endure—with most names being reversed after the Thermidorian Reaction—reveals the inherent limits of state-imposed cultural transformation when confronted with the deep-rooted inertia of popular memory and local tradition. By examining the legislative decrees, the actions of local bodies, and the specific changes in Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and communes across the nation, this analysis will illuminate how the streets of France became a literal and figurative territory of revolution.

  

## Part I: The Ideological Imperative: Forging a Republican Landscape

  

The mass renaming of streets, squares, and entire communes during the French Revolution was not a haphazard or spontaneous outburst but a deliberate campaign driven by a coherent set of ideological imperatives. The project was fundamentally about purification and re-education: purifying the public sphere of the symbolic vestiges of the Ancien Régime and re-educating the citizenry through a new, revolutionary lexicon embedded in their daily environment. This campaign was propelled by three interconnected ideological currents: the repudiation of monarchy and feudalism, the radical de-Christianization of society, and the construction of a new pantheon of republican heroes and virtues.

  

### Erasing the Symbols of Monarchy and Feudalism

  

The initial and most fundamental driver of toponymic change was the desire to eradicate all public reminders of the monarchy and the feudal system it commanded. This symbolic purge was a direct extension of the legal and political dismantling of the old order. The August Decrees of 1789, which famously declared that "The National Assembly entirely destroys the feudal regime," provided the foundational justification for removing its symbols from the urban landscape.4 Before the Revolution, the monarchy had systematically impressed its dominion upon the city, particularly in Paris. The expansion of the capital under kings like Henri IV and Louis XIII had produced a network of streets and squares named to honor the royal family—such as the

Rue Christine, the Place Dauphine, and the Rue Sainte-Anne (named for the patron saint of Queen Anne of Austria)—and powerful aristocrats loyal to the crown, like the Rue de Richelieu and the Rue de Vendôme.1 These names were not merely honorific; they were tangible assertions of royal power, a form of "symbolic eminent domain" that inscribed the hierarchy of the regime onto the city itself.1

For the revolutionaries, these names were constant, galling reminders of "tyranny" and "slavery".6 The campaign to erase them was therefore a crucial act of symbolic liberation. The most visible and significant of these acts was the renaming of Paris's great royal squares. The

Place Louis XV, an equestrian monument to the king's glory, was transformed into the Place de la Révolution on August 10, 1792, the day of the monarchy's overthrow. It was here, on this newly named ground, that Louis XVI would be executed in January 1793, a stark demonstration of the power of names to redefine space and reality.2 Similarly, the aristocratic

Place Royale in the Marais, a symbol of 17th-century courtly life, was renamed Place des Fédérés and later Place de l'Indivisibilité to celebrate national unity, while the opulent Place Vendôme became the Place des Piques, honoring the pike, the weapon of the sans-culottes and a symbol of popular power.9

This process was not confined to a few prominent squares. The National Convention's decree of 16 October 1793 (25 Vendémiaire, Year II) explicitly called for the removal of all names recalling "royalty, feudalism, or superstition," targeting words like "count, duke or king, castle".2 This led to a wave of changes across France. In Paris, the

Rue de Bourbon (named for the royal dynasty) was changed to Rue de Lille, and the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile ("Street of the King of Sicily") was reborn as the Rue des Droits-de-l'Homme ("Street of the Rights of Man").11 This toponymic purge was, in effect, a form of symbolic regicide performed on the urban body. The physical execution of the king severed the nation from its monarchical head; the erasure of royal names from the map was a parallel act designed to sever the citizenry's daily life from the memory of that monarchy. It was a performative act of political power, asserting that sovereignty now resided solely in the Nation, which was reclaiming and renaming its own territory.

  

### The De-Christianization Campaign and Secular Toponymy

  

Flowing from the same radical impulse was the campaign of de-Christianization, which reached its zenith during the Reign of Terror in 1793-94. This movement, rooted in the anti-clericalism of the Enlightenment and the revolutionaries' view of the Church as a counter-revolutionary force, sought to eradicate Catholicism from public life.13 The campaign involved the seizure of church property, the closure of churches, the promotion of a new Cult of Reason, and, most famously, the creation of the Republican Calendar to replace the Gregorian calendar, thereby abolishing Sunday as a day of rest and worship.13

A core component of this project was the débaptisation ("de-christening") of the landscape.16 Thousands of streets, squares, and communes across France bore the names of saints, a constant and pervasive reminder of the nation's Catholic past. The revolutionaries saw these names as emblems of "superstition" and systematically removed the prefix "Saint" (

Saint/Sainte) or changed the names entirely.2 In Paris, the

Section de Sainte-Geneviève was renamed Section du Panthéon-Français, transforming a Catholic patron saint into a secular monument to "great men." The Section de Notre-Dame became the Section de la Cité and then, at the height of the new cult, the Section de la Raison (Reason).9 The cathedral itself was designated a "Temple of Reason," and a public ceremony in November 1793 saw an actress crowned as the Goddess of Reason on its high altar.16

This process was replicated nationwide. Saint-Étienne, a major industrial city, was renamed Armeville ("Arms Town"), reflecting its new revolutionary purpose of manufacturing weapons for the Republic's armies.2 The town of

Saint-Denis, the ancient burial place of French kings, was renamed Franciade in a patriotic gesture.2

Saint-Tropez became Héraclée, adopting a classical name to erase its Christian one.15 This effort was part of a totalizing project to create a new, purely rational citizen. Just as the Republican Calendar sought to rationalize and de-Christianize

time, the toponymic changes sought to rationalize and de-Christianize space. Together, they represented a comprehensive attempt at environmental and psychological re-engineering, aiming to break the subconscious, daily link between the populace and the Church and replace it with a new civic consciousness. The fact that these measures were unevenly applied and often met with local opposition underscores that this was one of the most radical and ultimately resisted aspects of the Revolution.13

  

### Constructing a New Republican Pantheon

  

The revolutionary renaming was not solely a project of erasure; it was equally a project of construction. The blank spaces on the map created by the removal of kings and saints were filled with a new pantheon of heroes, virtues, and ideas intended to form a new "sacred geography" for the Republic.1 The new names were chosen for their pedagogical value, transforming the street into a permanent lesson in civics. This new republican toponymy can be classified into several key categories.

First and most revered were the Revolutionary Martyrs, those who had died for the cause. The assassinated radical journalist Jean-Paul Marat became the Revolution's foremost saint. His name was bestowed upon at least 20 communes and, most notably, on the influential Section du Théâtre-Français in Paris, which became the Section de Marat.10 Other martyred deputies, such as

Louis-Michel Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau and Lyon's radical leader Joseph Chalier, were similarly immortalized in the names of sections and streets.9

Second, to connect the French Republic with the perceived virtues of antiquity and bypass the "corrupt" monarchical past, revolutionaries turned to Classical Heroes. Names like Brutus (the Roman republican who overthrew a king), Mutius Scaevola (a Roman youth who defied an enemy king), and Guillaume Tell (the Swiss folk hero who resisted tyranny) were adopted for sections, streets, and towns.9

Third, the core principles of the Revolution were inscribed directly onto the map through Abstract Virtues. The revolutionary trinity of Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity) became a common naming convention, along with concepts like Unité (Unity), Indivisibilité, Raison (Reason), and La Loi (The Law).3 In Paris, the

Quai Bourbon became the Quai de la République, the Quai d'Anjou became the Quai de l'Union, and the Rue de Richelieu became the Rue de la Loi.11

Finally, the philosophical progenitors of the Revolution, the great thinkers of the Enlightenment, were honored. The Rue Plâtrière was renamed Rue Jean-Jacques-Rousseau after the philosopher who had once lived there, while the Quai des Théatins became the Quai Voltaire.3 This practice marked a decisive shift from the

honorific or descriptive naming conventions of the Ancien Régime to a new mode of ideological naming.1 The new names were not just tributes; they were political statements and didactic tools. This reflects a fundamental change in the conception of the state's role, from that of a distant, divinely ordained hierarchy to a pedagogical entity actively responsible for shaping the beliefs and values of its citizens.23

  

## Part II: The Mechanics of Change: Decrees, Committees, and Communes

  

The transformation of France's toponymy was not merely a series of spontaneous acts but was underpinned by a developing legislative framework and implemented through a network of national and local bodies. While popular revolutionary fervor often initiated the process, it was the decrees of the National Convention, the intellectual work of its committees, and the administrative actions of municipal governments like the Paris Commune that gave the renaming campaign its systematic character.

  

### The Legislative Framework: The Decree of 16 October 1793

  

The central piece of legislation governing the renaming of communes was the Decree of the National Convention of 16 October 1793 (25 Vendémiaire, Year II). This decree formally "invited" communes bearing names that could "recall memories of royalty, feudalism, or superstition" to provisionally adopt new, revolutionary names. These new names were then to be submitted to the Convention's Committee of Division for approval.2

This decree is significant for several reasons. It did not initiate the process of renaming, as many changes had already occurred spontaneously at the local level since 1789. Instead, it sought to channel, legitimize, and systematize this existing revolutionary energy. By providing a formal procedure, the Convention aimed to bring a degree of order to the movement and assert central authority over what had been a diffuse phenomenon.19 The use of the word "invite" rather than "command" is also noteworthy. It paid lip service to the principle of communal autonomy, a core revolutionary ideal, even as the Jacobin government was becoming increasingly centralized during the Terror. In practice, in the political climate of late 1793, such an "invitation" from the Convention carried the weight of a command, and communes that failed to comply risked being seen as politically suspect.

  

### The Intellectual Blueprint: The Abbé Grégoire's Proposal

  

While the October decree provided the legal mechanism, the intellectual and philosophical framework for the project was articulated most clearly by Abbé Henri Grégoire. In a report to the Convention in 1793 (published in early 1794), he presented a comprehensive "Systême de dénominations topographiques Pour les places, rues, quais etc. de toutes les communes de la République" (System of Topographical Denominations for the Squares, Streets, Quays, etc., of all the Communes of the Republic).6 Grégoire, a key figure in the Committee of Public Instruction, argued that the existing names of France were a chaotic and shameful legacy of "adulation and slavery" and proposed replacing them with a rational and patriotic system.

Grégoire's proposal was a quintessential product of the Enlightenment mind applied to urbanism. His principles included:

1. Eradication: A complete purge of names connected to royalty, feudalism, and religion, which he saw as offensive to republican principles.6
    
2. Rationalization and Utility: New names should be logical and useful. He suggested a geographical system where streets would be named for the towns they led to, with posts indicating the distance. This would make the city legible and serve a practical purpose.6
    
3. Pedagogy: The landscape should serve as a public textbook. Names should be drawn from great men (especially those of antiquity), celebrated historical events, or natural features, thereby instructing the populace in history, virtue, and science.6
    
4. Standardization and Process: The process should be formalized. Changes were to be decided by the general council of the commune based on the "manifested wish of the citizens," and a formal record (procès-verbal) was to be kept in the municipal archives.6
    

Grégoire's report reveals the tension between the passionate, sometimes chaotic, popular impulse to rename and the intellectual elite's desire to control and rationalize that impulse into a coherent national project. It demonstrates that street renaming was not merely a byproduct of the Terror's excesses but a considered element of revolutionary state-building, aimed at creating a new, enlightened, and unified national space.

  

### Local Implementation: The Paris Commune and the Sections

  

In Paris, the epicenter of the Revolution, the renaming process was driven by the interplay between the central municipal government and the radical neighborhood assemblies. The Paris Commune, the city's government from 1789 to 1795, was the official body responsible for ratifying name changes.25 It received petitions and proposals, debated them, and issued the formal decrees that made the changes official. The Commune's own headquarters, the Hôtel de Ville, was located on the

Place de Grève, which was symbolically renamed Place de la Maison-Commune ("Place of the Communal House") to reflect its new role as the center of popular sovereignty in the city.11

However, the true engines of radical toponymic change were the 48 revolutionary sections. These neighborhood-level assemblies, each with its own committee and popular militia, were the hotbeds of sans-culotte activism.9 It was within these sections that citizens debated new names, drafted petitions, and sent delegations to the Commune to demand the removal of offensive symbols. The most potent evidence of their role is the renaming of the sections themselves. The transformation of the

Section du Roi de Sicile into the Section des Droits de l'Homme, or the Section du Luxembourg into the Section de Mutius Scevola, demonstrates that the sections were both the agents and the subjects of this ideological purge, actively rewriting their own political identities onto the map of Paris.9

The official records of these changes would have been documented in primary sources like the Procès-verbaux de la Commune de Paris (Minutes of the Paris Commune) and reported in official newspapers such as the Gazette Nationale ou Le Moniteur Universel.27 While a full textual analysis of these voluminous sources is beyond the scope of this report, their existence confirms that, amidst the revolutionary fervor, a formal, documented process was followed, creating an official record of the city's textual transformation.

  

## Part III: An Atlas of Revolutionary Renaming

  

The ideological and procedural frameworks discussed previously resulted in a concrete and widespread transformation of the French landscape. This section provides an atlas of these changes, focusing on the crucible of Paris and the punitive renamings in the provinces, illustrating the depth and breadth of the toponymic revolution through specific examples.

  

### Paris: The Revolution's Crucible

  

The renaming campaign was at its most intense and symbolically charged in Paris. An estimated 1,400 streets were given new names, reflecting every phase of the Revolution's radicalization from 1791 to 1794.22 The changes were a direct assault on the monarchical and religious geography of the

Ancien Régime, replacing it with a new republican lexicon.

The following table presents some of the most iconic renamings of Parisian streets and squares. These examples vividly demonstrate the direct replacement of royal and religious names with those celebrating revolutionary principles, figures, and ideals. This list provides a crucial baseline for understanding both the aims of the campaign and the significance of its later reversal.

Beyond individual streets, the Revolution was mapped onto the entire political and administrative geography of the capital through the renaming of its 48 sections. This provides a uniquely comprehensive view of the ideological transformation of the city.

### The Revolution in the Provinces

  

The renaming campaign was a national phenomenon, though its application was uneven. A quantitative study by L. Meuriot, based on archival records, found that approximately 3,090 communes, or about 7.5% of the total, officially changed their names during the period.19 The intensity varied dramatically by department, reflecting local political dynamics and the prevalence of "suspect" names. The department of Rhône saw 33% of its communes renamed, while the largely German-speaking Bas-Rhin saw less than 1% change.19

The most dramatic instances of renaming occurred as acts of political punishment against cities that participated in the Federalist Revolts of 1793 against the Jacobin-dominated Convention.31 In these cases, toponymy was explicitly weaponized as a tool of repression in a civil war.

Lyon: After a brutal two-month siege, the city surrendered to the Convention's army on October 9, 1793.31 Three days later, the Convention issued a chilling decree:

"La ville de Lyon sera détruite... Le nom de Lyon sera effacé du tableau des villes de la République. La réunion des maisons conservées portera désormais le nom de Ville-Affranchie." ("The city of Lyon shall be destroyed... The name of Lyon will be erased from the list of cities of the Republic. The collection of preserved houses will henceforth bear the name of Liberated/Freed City.").31 A column was to be erected on the city's ruins bearing the inscription:

"Lyon fit la guerre à la Liberté; Lyon n'est plus." ("Lyon made war on Liberty; Lyon is no more.").34 The city's central square,

Place Bellecour, formerly Place Louis-le-Grand, had already been renamed Place de l'Égalité, and a guillotine was installed there to carry out the bloody repression that followed.35

Marseille: A key center of the Federalist Revolt, Marseille was also subjected to toponymic punishment. In 1794, the Convention decreed that the city, which had given its name to the revolutionary anthem, would be stripped of its identity and temporarily renamed Ville-sans-Nom ("Nameless City").2 This was the ultimate act of symbolic annihilation—not just renaming, but un-naming. It was a declaration that the city, by rebelling against the singular and indivisible Republic, had forfeited its very right to exist in the national consciousness.

These punitive renamings reveal a different facet of the toponymic project. While in Paris the changes were primarily about ideological construction, in the rebellious provinces, they became instruments of conquest and retribution, demonstrating the brutal logic of the Terror where political dissent was equated with treason, punishable by symbolic and literal erasure.

## Part IV: Reaction, Reversal, and Legacy

  

The revolutionary toponymic project, despite its ambition and systematic application during the Terror, proved to be remarkably ephemeral. Its effectiveness was hampered by practical challenges and its existence was intrinsically tied to the political fortunes of the radical Jacobins. The fall of Robespierre triggered a swift reversal, and while the physical names disappeared, the ideological precedent they set endured.

  

### Effectiveness and Public Reception

  

The rapid and widespread changes inevitably created administrative chaos. Contemporary accounts note the confusion faced by the postal service, whose agents struggled to navigate a landscape where familiar landmarks had vanished overnight from official maps.19 This practical disruption likely contributed to public resistance.

While committed revolutionaries and radicalized urban populations, particularly in the Parisian sections, embraced the new names, the extent of their adoption by the general populace is questionable. The changes were often perceived as being imposed from above by Parisian elites or radical clubs, meeting with local opposition and indifference, especially in more conservative rural areas.16 The persistence of oral culture and ingrained local memory proved a powerful counterforce to official decrees.1 Many of the old names remained physically carved into the stone of corner buildings, creating a dual nomenclature and a constant reminder of the previous identity.37 The very brevity of the experiment suggests that the new names never fully supplanted the old ones in the popular lexicon.

  

### The Thermidorian Reaction and Napoleonic Reversal

  

The political half-life of the revolutionary names was directly tied to the survival of the regime that created them. The Thermidorian Reaction, the coup d'état of 9 Thermidor, Year II (27 July 1794) that overthrew Maximilien Robespierre, marked the definitive end of the Reign of Terror and a sharp turn away from radical Jacobin policies.39 The new government, composed of more moderate republicans, immediately began dismantling the machinery of the Terror. They closed the Jacobin Club, abolished the revolutionary Paris Commune, and reined in the de-Christianization campaign, restoring freedom of worship in 1795.40

With the political power that had enforced the new names gone, the process of toponymic reversal began almost immediately. The names of martyred Jacobins like Marat and Chalier, once celebrated, were now reviled as symbols of the bloody Terror and were among the first to be removed. The Directory (1795-1799) continued this trend, and Napoleon Bonaparte accelerated it. While Napoleon created his own layer of toponymy, naming new streets and bridges for his victories (e.g., Pont d'Iéna, Rue de Rivoli) and his most loyal generals (Boulevards des Maréchaux), he systematically restored most of the pre-revolutionary names.3 He saw the revolutionary names as emblems of the anarchy and factionalism he sought to overcome with his own stable, imperial order. The final step came with the

Bourbon Restoration in 1814-1815. Louis XVIII, in a bid to erase the revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, restored the remaining monarchical and religious names, such as the Pont de la Concorde briefly reverting to Pont Louis XVI, as a symbolic re-establishment of the old legitimacy.21 Most of the revolutionary changes had been officially undone within two decades of their creation.2

The political trajectory of a single name can encapsulate this entire cycle. The Quai Bourbon became Quai de la République in 1792, only to revert to Quai Bourbon in 1814. The Quai d'Anjou became Quai de l'Union in 1792, but was reverted by Napoleon as early as 1803.21 This demonstrates that street names are a highly sensitive barometer of political power; their symbolic capital is only as stable as the regime that confers it.

  

### The Enduring Legacy

  

Despite the wholesale reversal, the revolutionary renaming campaign left a profound and lasting legacy. A handful of names did survive, often because their meaning evolved beyond pure factionalism. The most famous example is the Place de la Concorde. Its journey from Place Louis XV to Place de la Révolution—the site of the guillotine—and finally to Place de la Concorde in 1795 is telling. The name "Concord" was chosen by the Thermidorian government as a deliberate gesture of reconciliation, a public expression of the desire to move past the bloodshed and civil strife of the Terror.2 It survived precisely because its name symbolized an end to factionalism, not a continuation of it. Similarly, the

Quai Voltaire retained its name, as Voltaire's status as a national literary icon transcended the specific politics of the Jacobins who first honored him.11

The most significant legacy, however, was not in the names that survived but in the act of renaming itself. The Revolution permanently established the principle that the urban landscape is a political space, a text to be actively written and rewritten by the state to reflect its values and legitimize its power.46 The streets of France, and Paris in particular, became a contested palimpsest. The practice was continued by Napoleon, the Restoration, the Second Empire, and every subsequent Republic.3 This politicization of toponymy, born in the crucible of 1793, remains a potent force in France and around the world today, where debates over the removal of statues and the renaming of public spaces continue to echo the fundamental questions of memory, identity, and power first unleashed on the streets of revolutionary Paris.

  

## Conclusion: The Ephemeral Republic of Names

  

The attempt to rename the streets and communes of France during the Revolution stands as one of the most radical and revealing experiments of the era. It was a literal effort to construct a new world by changing the words used to describe it. Driven by a potent ideological cocktail of anti-monarchism, anti-clericalism, and a fervent belief in the pedagogical power of the state, the revolutionaries sought to erase the Ancien Régime and inscribe the Republic into the very stone and soil of the nation. The process, codified in national decrees and propelled by the zeal of local communes and radical Parisian sections, was systematic and widespread, reaching its zenith during the Terror of 1793-94. The renaming of Lyon to Ville-Affranchie and Marseille to Ville-sans-Nom demonstrates the ultimate weaponization of this practice as a tool of political punishment.

However, this "Republic of Names" proved to be as ephemeral as the radical phase of the Revolution that birthed it. The administrative chaos it created, combined with the deep resilience of local memory and the swift political reversal after the fall of Robespierre, ensured that the vast majority of these changes were undone. The revolutionary names were a layer of text quickly written and just as quickly erased by the succeeding regimes of the Directory, the Empire, and the Restoration, each of which used toponymy to assert its own legitimacy. The project's failure highlights a crucial lesson in the history of cultural politics: the state's power to impose a new symbolic order is limited when it clashes with deeply embedded traditions and the lived experience of its people. Yet, the project left an indelible mark. It permanently established the practice of political toponymy in France, transforming the street from a simple place into a perpetual battleground for public memory and ideological legitimacy, a legacy that continues to shape urban landscapes to this day.
