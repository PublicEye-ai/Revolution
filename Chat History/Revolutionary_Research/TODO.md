## üí≠ Final Thoughts

This TODO list is itself a living document, meant to evolve as we learn more about building just, stable, AI-assisted governance systems. The goal is not to complete every item but to continuously improve our understanding and tools for navigating this critical transition in human governance.

Priority should always go to:
1. **Real-world testing** over theoretical development
2. **Practical tools** over abstract frameworks
3. **Inclusive participation** over expert dominance
4. **Historical wisdom** over technological optimism
5. **Human welfare** over system efficiency

Remember: The perfect is the enemy of the good. Better to implement something useful now than wait for the perfect system that never arrives.
